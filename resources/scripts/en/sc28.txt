At long last ...
Finally, it's all mine ...{06}{07}
With Alhazard, I can
revive Chaos and
destroy this filthy world!{06}{07}
Well Alhazard ...
Let me see your power!{end}

Aha ha ha!
Now the humans are like
mice in a room of cats!{06}{07}
Run out and play, humans!{end}

Sonya, don't revive Chaos!
You have no idea how
terrible he is!{end}

Alhazard, my wish is for the
destruction of all life on this
miserable excuse for a world!{end}

You won't get
away with this!{end}

Just you watch me!
No one can even touch me!{06}{07}
Not as long as
I have Alhazard!
Aha ha ha!{end}

Let us make a sacrifice
of the Descendants of Light
to our glorious god!{06}{07}
Everyone, make sure they don't
interfere with my plan!{06}{07}
...
Not that I even need to ask
you any more. With Alhazard in
my grasp, {font3}I{font0} am your master!{end}

{font3}Indeed ...{end}

{font3}Mwa ha ha ...
{font3}Long live Chaos!{end}

Destruction! Death!
Alhazard, enrapture me with
your power ...{06}{07}
This bliss ...{end}

Sonya, I understand your
feelings, really I do.{06}{07}
But a girl like you should
not utter such things. {end}

Sonya ...{end}

You're wrong, Sonya!{06}{07}
I understand ...
That sadness in the bottom
of your heart, your hatred
for humans ...{06}{07}
B{3a}ser has taken 
advantage of that and 
used it to further
his ambitions.{06}{07}
But by destroying everyone,
you will be no better than
the people who scorned you!{end}

Humans aren't as bad
as you think! Not all humans
would persecute you!{end}

Sonya ...{end}

Shut up!
What do you know
about anything!?{end}

This is the end!
Everyone, attack!{end}

A face on the wall
begins speaking.{06}{07}

"Would you,
Knowing what's in store,"{06}{07}

"Memory relegated to lore,
Choose this life once more?"{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

"Really ...,
well in that case ..."{06}{07}

The face on the
wall fell silent.{end}

We will definitely 
seal the power of evil!{end}

I am an ancient god.
The power of humanity is too
weak to oppose my will.{end}

Sonya, stop!{end}

Shut up, shut the fuck up!
Stop fucking with my head!
I won't fall for your tricks!{end}

Damn--!{end}

It's no good ...
The power of evil--{end}

I trust my magic is
strong enough--even strong
enough to take on a god.{end}

Gaahhh--!
I'm finished ...{end}

Victory must
be ours!{end}

I'm exhausted ...{end}

For this world ...
We mustn't give up, or evil
shall reign eternal!{end}

Damn ...
My strength
is at its end--{end}

Arggh!
You will die!{end}

Sorry, everyone ...{end}

I won't fail!
Even before
a dark god!{end}

No!
I just didn't cut it ...{end}

Lushiris, please
give me power!{06}{07}
We need the power of
light to defeat Chaos!{end}

Sonya ...
There is no need to fight!
We're both human beings!{end}

Shut up!
You filthy hypocrite!{end}

Sorry, {02} ...{end}

I'm no longer controlled
by B{3a}ser! I won't return
to a life of darkness!{end}

I'm sorry,
everyone ...{end}

Aahh ... 
How beautiful
the sky is ...{end}

{font3}...{end}

{font3}...{end}

{font3}We will follow Sonya's
{font3}orders to the letter ...{end}

{font3}How could
{font3}humans defeat me ...{end}

{font3}How could a human
{font3}be this strong ...{end}

{font3}Aarrrghh!{end}

{font3}Ugghh--{end}

{font3}Gaahhh!{end}

Behold the mighty
Descendants of Light!{06}{07}
I won't hold
back any more!{06}{07}
Go forth my servants!
Obey the wielder
of Alhazard!{end}

{font3}Gaaahhhh--!{end}

{font3}Argh!{end}

{font3}Gah--!{end}

The Descendants of Light
who wield Langrisser ...{06}{07}
Convince me of this power of
humans which you so valiantly
strive to conquer me with.{end}

Go forth, destroy everything.
Let Chaos ensue and restore
this planet to its natural state.{end}

Don't interfere!
Those who do
will be destroyed.{end}

Langrisser!
Give us your power!{end}

Thus is the power of
Langrisser, the 
Sword of Light ...{end}

It is our unity and 
hope for peace that 
brought us this victory!{06}{07}
We didn't depend 
wholly on Langrisser!{end}

But they are one
and the same.{06}{07}
The Holy Blade's
ability isn't raw 
destructive power ...{06}{07}
Don't you understand the
real nature of Langrisser?
Don't you know how it offers
such limitless strength?{06}{07}
It is a symbol which
combines a gathered
people's hearts into one.{06}{07}
It brings humans together
and shows them the
infinite power of hope.{end}

But why is it called
the one and only sword that
can oppose Alhazard ...?{end}

Alhazard is also
a symbol, but for
the Demon Tribe.{06}{07}
Those who gather under
the sword's banner
can change their fate!{end}

And I am the Lord of Chaos.
Things aren't
finished yet, mortals!{end}

It seems
it's my turn ...{end}

I have no regrets ...
This will seal Chaos
once and for all!{06}{07}
My final spell ...
A demon banishing
ray of holy thunder!{end}

Wait, Egbert!
If you use that spell,
your life will ...!{end}

Oh gods that
rule this world!{06}{07}
Make my spirit shine, and
give me the strength to
vanquish the darkness!{06}{07}
{font4}Halig Geweald
{font4}Ealles Fordon Fynd ...
{font4}Holy Falcon Ray!{end}

Noooo!{06}{07}
How could you ...
How could you 
use that spell!{end}

Teacher--{end}

Such are the 
sacrifices made 
in war ...{end}

It makes one wonder
if all our fighting 
has been worth it ...{end}

It was not a waste.{06}{07}
To save this world
from Chaos, we needed
to act together.{end}

Hmph, well then, I shall
take my leave of you.{06}{07}
However, you
best not mistakenly think
you have "won."{06}{07}
When this world
calls for me again ...
I will return.{06}{07}
My ... power ...
is eternal--{end}

Chaos has ...
The evil surge
is dissipating ...{end}

It was a long,
hard battle.{end}

Chaos ...{06}{07}
Once I learnt your
revival was at hand, I began
my search for a way
to banish you forever!{06}{07}
And now, my research
has come to fruition!
Your life force is sealed!{end}

You've outlived your time,
you arrogant pest.{06}{07}
With magic power
gnawing, eating away
your body, you've lived
an unnaturally long life.{end}

Until the menace of evil
is no more, I will not die!{06}{07}
To end darkness forever, 
I offer no less than my soul.{06}{07}
Relatives, loved ones, I
will sacrifice it all to
keep peace in this land!{end}

I will use all of my 
power and banish you
once and for all!{end}

How can this be!?
How can I die without
sealing Chaos ...{end}

In just a little bit ...
In just a little bit 
Chaos shall return ...{06}{07}
We will destroy
the humans ... yes--{end}

Sonya ...{end}

Sonya ...{end}

Blood is ... My blood ...
Heh ... ha ... ha--!
Alhazard, drink!{06}{07}
Chaos! I sacrifice the blood
of both Demons and Humans
to your glory! Awaken from
your long slumber!{06}{07}
Don't think this is over ...
Chaos will ... Chaos wi--{end}

No! Alhazard is 
emitting an insane 
amount of dark energy!{end}

Al, Alhazard is
going wild ...!
This power is--{end}

Damn!{end}

Chaos!
You've granted my wish!{end}

I am the God of Chaos.
Your sacrifice
has brought me here.{end}

{02}!
Chaos has awoken!{end}

Chaos!{end}

My name is Chaos.{06}{07}
Starting now, I will
accomplish the goal for
which I was created.{end}

Is that evil incarnate!?{end}

I was born with
the dawn of time.{06}{07}
My purpose is to
see this world remains in
the flames of chaos for
the whole of eternity.{06}{07}
For the sake of evolution,
I maintain a state of entropy.
I will break all.{end}

We won't allow that!{end}

You think you can stop us
from bringing this land
a well-deserved peace?{end}

Peace violates the
rules of the universe.{06}{07}
All who would stand
against turmoil and destruction
will be eradicated.{end}

I won't let you do that!
I will seal you
with Langrisser!{end}

Then come challenge me.
Witness the limitation of
useless, fleeting life ...{end}

How can you ...
How can {font3}you
{font3}{font0}understand me!?{06}{07}
Humans, humans ... 
whenever something bad 
happened people spat on me
and blamed me ...{06}{07}
My blood is mixed with the
Demon Tribe's so they thought
I was the cause of everything.{end}

But humans aren't the only
ones who've betrayed me.{06}{07}
My own brethren I believed
in, the Demon Tribe--even
they turned against me!{06}{07}
I've controlled the
ones who've humiliated
me with Alhazard.{06}{07}
Later, I will pay
you humans back!{06}{07}
With Alhazard's power I will
destroy this stupid world!
Then we can perish together!{end}

It's finished!
Alhazard and Langrisser will
merge into nothingness.{06}{07}
Balance will be restored
and you'll never awaken.{end}

I'll help you.
To seal Chaos, I know an
ancient, forbidden spell--{06}{07}
The Holy Falcon Ray.{06}{07}
If His Majesty was
still here, we might have
prepared it together ...{end}

Holy Falcon Ray ...
to perform this spell--{06}{07}
Oh no! Egbert, don't!
It requires the sacrifice
of the caster's soul!{end}

This is my way to take
responsibility! But I can't
hit him with the spell yet ...{06}{07}
{02}, please
weaken Chaos!{end}

...
All right.{end}

Even in the end,
she still couldn't
believe in humans ...{06}{07}
How sad ...{end}

It's so sad ...{end}

This is all because of
Alhazard's existence.{end}
