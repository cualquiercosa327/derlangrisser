Where are the ancient texts?
Hand them over and
you won't be harmed.{end}

I'd never hand them
to Imperials like you!{end}

No!
You must not awaken
the powers of darkness!{end}

With its vast power at our
command, the continent can be
unified. Surrender quietly!{end}

If we meet our defeat this day,
our country will meet its end!
We cannot give in!{end}

Stubborn fools ...
Then feel the power of the
Water Dragon Navy!{end}

Now that I know why the
Empire wants the Dark Rod,
I'll stop you at all costs!{end}

Even knowing I am General
Vargas you would still fight?
Interesting ... then have at you!{end}
