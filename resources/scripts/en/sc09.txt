You must find stronger
allies to offer protection.{06}{07}
Though I am Lord of Salrath,
even my forces cannot stand
against the Rayguard Empire.{end}

To pursue Liana, the
Empire must have some
special plans for her.{06}{07}
Recently, it has been invading
every neighbouring kingdom
that does not submit to the
Kaiser's will ...{end}

Indeed ...
There must be more to their
ambitions than first apparent.{06}{07}
Perhaps, if Liana were guarded
within Estool's Shrine of Light,
their efforts would be stymied.{end}

You're right!
The great shrine priest
can surely help us.{end}

I'm sorry, everyone.
It seems I become an ever
greater burden.{end}

Please don't think like that.
It's not your fault.{06}{07}
The journey to Estool is
far too dangerous for you to
undertake alone, Liana.{end}

I'm more and more curious
as to why the Empire is
after you ...{06}{07}
And with that purpose, it
appears my "aimless journey"
is no longer so aimless.{end}

Everyone, ...
thank you so much.{end}

Well then, father,
I shall take leave of you now.{end}

This is a great opportunity
for you to apply your
education, young Scott.{06}{07}
Study well, and use what I have
taught you to aid {02}
and his companions.{end}

{02}, I entrust you
with Liana's safety.{06}{07}
Scott, please look after
her on the road to Estool.{end}

As you order, father.{end}

All right!
Let's be off!{end}

What the ...!?
It seems we have some
unexpected guests ...{end}

There they are!
Their progress was even
slower than anticipated.{end}

What ...?
It's the Blue Dragon Knights!{end}

We, the Blue Dragon Knights,
are charged with obtaining
custody of Lady Liana.{06}{07}
By edict of the Kaiser,
if you value your lives, do not
interfere in our mission!{end}

...{end}

Liana!
Pay them no mind!{end}

Hein is right!{06}{07}
There's no reason for you
to acquiesce to the demands
of those Imperials!{end}

Knights of the Empire,
you are trespassers
in my territory!{06}{07}
Your forces have no
business intervening here.
Leave the way you came!{end}

I'm afraid we cannot
do that, Lord Loren.{06}{07}
You leave us no choice!
Knights, we will take
Liana by force!{end}

{02}, I will stay here
and cut off their path.{06}{07}
Take Lady Liana north
along this road.
It leads to Estool.{06}{07}
Do not worry about me!
You can't waste any more time.
I don't know how long I can
hold them off, so hurry!{end}

Can I really protect Liana ...?{end}

I will take care of
their commander.
The rest of you, after the girl!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Understood!{end}

As you command!{end}

Liana!
Break through, and run for it!{end}

Okay!{end}

Will you change your
instructions for Liana?{end}

They're tougher than I thought!
Don't let her get away!{end}

Hein, have you learnt
the spell Attack?{06}{07}
It can increase the attack
power of one of your
hired units for one turn.{end}

Of course!
You won't find me a fool when
it comes to support magic.{end}

I made it ...{end}

Well done!
Estool is just a little
further down this road!{end}

Okay!{end}

It's hopeless.
I must withdraw ...{end}

I can't believe we've
managed to elude
the Imperial Army again.{end}

You're doing well!
Keep heading down the road!{end}

You're doing well!
Keep heading down the road!{end}

You're doing well!
Keep heading down the road!{end}

You're doing well!
It's only a little further!{end}

Okay!{end}

In a clearing in the woods,
you find small footprints ...{06}{07}
One set of foot prints
leads towards a small hole.{end}

Do you want to look inside?{end}

Obtained Swift Boots.{end}

At the top of the hill, you
see a large, mysterious tree.{06}{07}

You notice strange fruits
scattered about beneath it.{end}

Do you want to taste one?{end}

A surge of power flows
instantly through your body!{06}{07}

AT raised by 1 point!{end}

Here I come!{end}

It will take more than
that to stop us!
We'll defend Liana to the end!{end}

You'll regret not listening
to us obediently.{end}

I can't be defeated ...
I must protect Liana--!{end}

Everything was peaceful
until you bastards arrived.{end}

Our mission is complete.
Let's return to headquarters.{end}

No, get away!
Leave me alone!{end}

Liana!{end}

I can't let it end like this ...
If only I had more power--!{end}

Unfortunately, we are no
match for the Imperials with
our current manpower.{06}{07}
I will hold the line.
Please hurry down
the road to Estool.{end}

Stay out of my way!{end}

Oh no!
If only I was stronger ...!{end}

It's payback time!{end}

So this is my fate ...
It seems this war will be fought
by a younger generation.{06}{07}
But, as long as there's life in
this body, the Imperials
won't reach the shrine.{06}{07}
I must buy Scott more time ...
He has great potential,
but lacks experience.{end}

So this is my fate ...
It seems this war will be fought
by a younger generation.{06}{07}
But, as long as there's life in
this body, the Imperials
won't reach the shrine.{end}

How dreadful!
I cannot permit Imperial scum
to roam freely in my lands!{end}

I am ... done for--{end}

Father!
You can't fight any more
in that condition!{06}{07}
Please retire from the field.{end}

Then I'll trust you to
hold off the enemy ...
You must get Liana to safety!{end}

Quick!
After the girl!{end}

Well then, which one
looks most challenging?{end}

Those guys look like
they'll be entertaining.{end}

Ludicrous!
You really believe you
will be able to best me!?{end}

I follow my blade!{end}

General Leon!{end}

General Leon!
Villages in the Empire's
borderlands are under attack!{06}{07}
Monsters are inflicting heavy
casualties on the villagers!{end}

What!?
Then my home town could
be in danger ...!{06}{07}
If I don't return to
defend them ...
No, that's too horrible ...{end}

Colonel Laird!
I leave you in charge. I must
hurry to the village.{end}

Yes, Sir!
General, will you be all
right by yourself?{end}

I can deal with the monsters
on my own. You are to
complete our mission here!{end}

Understood, Sir!{end}

I ... no way ...
How can I be defeated
by such--!{end}

I will cut down
anyone who stands
in our way!{end}

We are acting under Imperial
orders! This your last warning.
Do not get in our way!{end}

I will not allow you to
do as you wish!
At all costs, I will stop you!{end}

Don't be a fool!
How can you hold back
all our forces alone?{06}{07}
Consider this carefully.
Don't throw your life away!{end}

I cannot back down!
While I live, you will not
capture that girl!{06}{07}
Even if you are the
Imperial Blue Dragon Knights,
I will not be easily bested!{end}

Similar words have
been spoken by those who
lie dead and buried.{06}{07}
If death is the only way,
then have at you!{end}

It's ... It's not over yet--!{end}

I mustn't lose, I must ...{end}

It's ... not over yet. I--!{end}

I ... can't believe it ...{end}

If I lose ... then ...?{end}

I lost!? Impossible--!{end}

Damn ...
How could I have failed--!{06}{07}
General Leon, I apologise
for this disgrace ...
I am forced to disengage!{end}

You dare interfere!?
Then prepare to
meet a swift end!{end}

Again, I am bested by you--!
Damn it!{end}

Shit!
They are too strong--!{end}

How, how can I--?{end}

I take pride in having served
for the glory of the Empire!{end}

General ... Leon!{end}

Such ...
How could I have made
such a mistake ...{end}

This can't be happening ...
To be defeated like this ...{end}

Shit ...
I had the tactical advantage ...{06}{07}
How could I have
been defeated ...!?{end}

Grrr!{end}

Eeek!{end}

Liana!
Are you all right?{end}

I, I think so ...{end}

Everyone!
We must protect Liana!{end}

At any rate, let's hurry!
More Imperial reinforcements
may come at any time.{end}

Should Liana head north
along the road alone?{end}

Liana, head north
along the road to Estool!
We'll hold them off!{end}

O, okay!{end}

Liana, you'll be safe at my side.{end}

Are you confident you
can protect Liana?{end}

Are you sure?
Thank you ... {02}.{end}

No matter the trouble,
I'll defend you with my life!
Don't leave my side!{end}

Okay!{end}

Don't worry, I'll protect her!{end}

Will you entrust Hein
with defending Liana?{end}

Thank you, Hein.
I'm sure I would only be
a burden to {02}.{end}

I'm counting on you then, Hein!{end}

Of course! I'll protect
her with my life!{end}

Why not leave her to me, then?{end}

Will you ask
Scott to protect Liana?{end}

I appreciate your kindness.{end}

Please, ...
take good care of her.{end}

Fear not, I will
ensure her safety!{end}

Get them!{end}

Oh, shit!
It's an ambush!{end}

I'll slow them down!
You must break through!
Don't let them harm Liana!{end}

Surround them!
If we work together, they
won't have a chance!{end}

Oh, shit!
Even more Imperial soldiers ...!{end}

Damn it to hell!
If only I could have held
out a little longer--!{end}

Someone is coming!{end}

What have we here?
It seems the Imperial Army is
yet again bullying weaklings.{end}

You bastard!
Mind your own business
or die by my blade!{end}

I was just passing through,
but I'll help you
against the Imperial Army.{06}{07}
Hey, redhead! Let me give you
a piece of advice.
You need to keep your cool--
and stop being so reckless!{end}

Who is this guy and
where is he from ...?{06}{07}
He doesn't seem to be
one of the Imperials ...{end}

I think he's a mercenary.
Why would he ...?{end}

Halt, stranger!
What is your business here ...?{06}{07}
Too late ... he's already left.{end}

What a shame!
I hoped to hear the story
behind the men I was killing.{end}

Thanks for helping us.
I am {02}, a traveller.
Who are you?{end}

I'm Rohga, a mercenary.
So what do the Imperials
want with the girl?{end}

Honestly, we don't know either.
For now we're just
trying to get her to safety.{end}

That's it? Not a very
interesting story so far!{06}{07}
Well, I can't reveal much about
myself for personal reasons.
Maybe some day I'll be
able to tell you more.{06}{07}
I bet it's quite a bitch having
the Empire after you, isn't it?{end}

Look, as much as
I'd love to chat, ...{06}{07}
We really must be off.
We're on our way to Estool to
seek the priest's help.{end}

I see.{06}{07}
Well, we really must be off.
We're on our way to Estool
to seek the priest's help.{end}

Estool?
I'm on my way there as well.{end}

Really?
In that case, let's go together.{end}

Whew, it's finally over.{end}

The Imperial Army won't
give up so easily, though.{end}

When will it all end ...?{end}

Cough--!
Is the Imperial Army gone?{end}

It's safe for now.
They've retreated.{end}

Damn!
I can't die here!
Please have mercy--!{end}

Don't worry, you're
going to be okay.
My name is {02}.{end}

I'm Rohga.{06}{07}
I was searching for
someone when ...
the soldiers ... gah ... argh!{end}

Please, try not to
move so much.
Your wound is serious!{end}

Why not come with us,
at least until your wound
has had time to heal.{end}

I'm on the verge of
death and you still want
me to follow you ...?{06}{07}
Well, all right then!
I guess I'll tag along and
see what you can do ...{end}

By the way, Liana ...{06}{07}
Do you have any idea
what the Imperial Knights
want with you?{end}

None at all ...{end}

By the way, Liana ...{06}{07}
Do you have any idea
what the Imperial Knights
want with you?{end}

None at all ...{end}

Wait.
I have something for you before
you depart. Take this sword.{end}

Obtained Long Sword.{end}

Thank you, I will
surely guard it.{end}

You must keep a
careful eye on the road.{end}

You need to stay alert.{end}

As you say, father.{end}

Colonel! If something
happens to you, the General
would be most put out.{06}{07}
Please, withdraw from the fray!{end}
