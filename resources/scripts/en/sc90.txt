Most well done!
With your help, we obtained
both Alhazard and Langrisser.{end}

With the two swords,
Your Majesty's desires can
finally be realised.{end}

We finally have the
power we need to unite
our continent.{end}

One land, one king!
The age of war
should be over for good.{end}

We were also able to
capture both maidens ...{06}{07}
After uniting the continent,
we can seal the Dark Blade
so the Darkness never returns.{end}

Hmmm ... {02}!{end}

Yes, Your Majesty?{end}

Your actions during this trying
time were impeccable.{06}{07}
Having seen your skill, I bestow
upon you the rank of general.
You will command the Radiant
Dragon Knights, a Royal Guard.{end}

Your Majesty ... thank you!
I shall prove to be
reliable in your service!{end}

As for you, Hein ...
You are fit to inherit command
of the Dark Dragon Sorcerers ...{end}

What!?
R, really ...?{end}

Are you surprised, little boy?{end}

I am going to become the
Empire's ambassador and will
aid the Kaiser's diplomacy.{06}{07}
I will work to benefit the
continent, and to ensure
this era remains free of war.{end}

Our first battle has ended.{06}{07}
I trust you shall continue
to do your best to succeed.
For the sake of a peaceful
tomorrow, go forth!{end}

Yes, my Liege!{end}

Rohga?{end}

Where are you headed?{end}

My journey has ended ...
There is nothing left for me ...{end}

Rohga ...{end}

I should have done more ...
I could have done more ...
Sonya should not have died.{06}{07}
Since I can't continue fighting
my way from country to
country any more, I'm giving
up my days as a mercenary.{06}{07}
I don't know what the future
holds for me, but I can't
just dwell on Sonya's fate
and sit on my ass!{end}

Why not just take a vacation?
You can always return one day
when you feel differently.{end}

I can't promise anything.{06}{07}
But, if I do change my mind,
I might show up to make your
lives miserable for a while!{end}

Disperse and strike!
If we beat these guys,
this port will be ours!{end}

Get them!
These guys are the only thing
between us and our booty!{end}

I demand you cease and desist!
Halt this senseless violence!{end}

Th, the Rayguard Empire!?{end}

Who cares!?
Kill them too! Ha ha!{end}

Ugh!
My, my legs are ...{end}

It seems I overestimated you.{end}

Die!
You bastards!{end}

H, how can this be ...!?{end}

Now that you've witnessed
our power, do you still plan to
continue this fight?{end}

How strong ...!
Th, they're ... too much!{end}

If you fools are looking for
a swift end, then by
all means, keep fighting!{end}

Why make us spill more blood?
Give up and surrender!{end}

Fine ...!{end}

We surrender ...{end}

Another nation
fell to us easily.{end}

You speak too soon.
Until the day El Sallia is free
of all war, we can never rest.{end}

Until we've wiped the
continent clean of war ...?{06}{07}
We have already come so far ...
El Sallia's age of peace
is just over the horizon!{end}
