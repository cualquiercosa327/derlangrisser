Hey you!
Aren't you willing to lay
down your arms yet!?{end}

Argh!
But we've come so far ...{06}{07}
Take this!{end}

Shit!
It's no use ... I tried to talk him
out of carrying on like this.{06}{07}
How about you then?
Can't you just admit defeat
and surrender to us?{end}

Damn, they're so strong!
But if we lose now ...!{end}

Can you seriously keep going?
Hrmm, if you insist on
fighting, then I won't hold back!{end}

We were lucky ...
This victory came easily.{end}

These ones are probably
the last of their troops.{06}{07}
All the others have left,
none of them was fool enough
to keep resisting us.{end}

Well then, is our battle ended?{end}

Take a look around!
It seems pretty obvious to me!{end}

In that case, we should
hurry back to the castle!{06}{07}
Are you ready to
return to King {02}?{end}

Yeah, I'm on my way!
Wait up!{end}

King {02}.{06}{07}
The years of battle have
left the borderlands in ruin.
We're working to sweep out
the last of the rebels.{end}

I'm sorry for all the hardships
I've put you through. If only the
unification were peaceful ...{06}{07}
That reminds me, Sonya.
What is happening with
the Demon Tribe?{end}

The Demon Tribe has agreed
not to attempt to use Alhazard
to leave Velzeria.{06}{07}
There haven't been any
new reports of monsters
invading human lands.{end}

Thank god ... then coexistence
of humans and demons may
finally become possible.{end}

It's what we all wish for now!{end}

And what of your plans, Hein?{end}

I'm currently conducting
research on forbidden forms
of attack magic.{06}{07}
But more importantly ... I'm
trying to discover the magic
of living a happy life, hee hee!{end}

Well said ...
Hein, I hope you find the
magic you're looking for.{end}

We shared these hardships
together, and in time, our
pain will surely fade.{end}

Everyone, you're dismissed.{end}

{font3}Gruu ...{end}

Over that half-year of violent
battle, I united the continent.{06}{07}
But with the death of the
gods, Langrisser and Alhazard
have lost their powers.{06}{07}
At the least ... the orphans left
in the wake of war will taste
the times of peace we barely
dared to dream as children ...{end}

One day ... I want to
experience and celebrate this
new land of ours with you.{06}{07}
Liana ...{end}

{02} ...{end}

Liana!?
You're here!?
Wh, why ... how ...?{end}

Oh {02} ...
I wanted to congratulate you.{06}{07}
You've accomplished so much.
This continent has
finally broken free from
its dark times of war ...{end}

Yes ... we did it,
We actually did it ...{06}{07}
Oh Liana ... our promise,
I ... I ... still--!{end}

Oh {02} ...
Don't say anything.{06}{07}
I understand the pains
you've gone through ...
I wanted to thank you.{06}{07}
{02}, you really
did keep your promise!
You've brought peace
to our world ...{end}

...{end}

I don't want to go so soon ...
But I don't have a choice.{end}

Liana ...{end}

Liana ... I can protect you!
This peace ... this is
the world you love!{06}{07}
Until my flame of life
burns out, I'll show you I
can protect it all!{end}

King {02}!
We've found the girl
you told us about!{end}

You ... you what?{end}

It seems she founded a
orphanage in a nearby village
to care for children of the war.{06}{07}
She requested Your Majesty
send money to aid in their
continued care taking.{end}

I see ...
Send the orphanage 50,000P.{06}{07}
As king ... this is all I can do.
I'm never able to help people
with my own hands any more ...{06}{07}
The longer time flows on ...
the more I understand what
we've lost in the wars.{06}{07}
Thank you, you are dismissed.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Over that half-year of violent
battle, I united the continent.{06}{07}
But with the death of the
gods, Langrisser and Alhazard
have lost their powers.{06}{07}
At the least ... the orphans left
in the wake of war will taste
the times of peace we barely
dared to dream as children ...{end}
