I beg of you,
please don't do this!{06}{07}
We rely on our 
boats for fish to eat!
You are condemning our
village to starve!{end}

Since you won't
shut your mouth,
I'll shut it for you.{06}{07}
Listen, all of you!
Anyone who does not
cooperate will end
up like this man!{end}

No-- Gahh--!{end}

How horrible ...{end}

Hmph, that will teach you
to respect your Empire!{06}{07}
Men, burn everything
to the ground!
Our enemies won't
take these ships.{end}

Yes, General!{end}

I'm leaving the
rest of this to you.{06}{07}
I'm not wasting any
more time here.{end}

Don't worry about a
thing, Lady Imelda. Your
orders are absolute!{end}

Ready, men?
Get the kindling, prepare
some oil and torches!{06}{07}
We'll have us a little
barbecue tonight, hmm?
And don't forget to pay special
attention to those ships!{end}

Hmmm, looks like
this village is next.{end}

Such a beautiful woman ...!
How may we help you?{end}

Silence!{06}{07}
The Water Dragon Navy
will be taking control
of this village's shipyard,
including all vessels.{end}

What? Why!?
What did we ever do ...?{06}{07}
Besides, the men are
still out fishing.
We have no ships now!{end}

Hmmm ...
a favourable circumstance ...{06}{07}
We will retain you until
the boats are secured.
Tell your men that your
lives depend on it.{end}

O, oh my ...{end}

Noisy wenches ...!{06}{07}
The enemy must
be prevented from
boarding any ship!{end}

{02}!{06}{07}
What is Imelda
doing to the villagers!?{end}

Imelda, we're not
going to allow this!{end}

Tsk, you boys again!
You certainly
catch up fast ...{06}{07}
But you won't
get your hands on
a single vessel.{end}

Kill the women like
cows to the slaughter!{06}{07}
Maybe that will
convince those
fishermen to offer
us their boats.{06}{07}
We can't let them
fall into enemy hands!{end}

Hee hee.
That sounds fun.{06}{07}
I would love to chop
up some little girls.{end}

What on earth!?
We have to stop this!{06}{07}
They're going to
murder them all!{end}

These crass fools ...
Begin the counterattack!{end}

I can't lose
to fools like you!{end}

Why are you against us?
Surely you're not acting
in B{3a}ser's interest!?{end}

Obviously, bowing down
to the Demon Tribe is
quite unbecoming of me.{06}{07}
However, I was told
to serve Lord B{3a}ser should
His Majesty perish.{06}{07}
The Kaiser's last request ...{end}

What foolishness!{06}{07}
You mean you're consorting
with demons for the
sake of a dead man's wish?{end}

I will not
discuss this further.{06}{07}
Watch closely.
You're about to lose.{end}

{02}!
We can't waste time!{06}{07}
Innocent lives
are at stake!
If we don't act soon ...{end}

I know!{06}{07}
Rush in and strike
with all your strength!{06}{07}
Their force is
large, so we'll have
to scatter them.{end}

Releasing the anchor
caused a chain to drop.{06}{07}

Will you pick it up?{end}

A voice resonates
from the chain ...{06}{07}

"You ... human,
I shall lend you my strength."{06}{07}

"I have awaited your arrival
for thousands of years ..."{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{end}

Ugh!
Is this the end ...?{end}

Argh!
It looks like this
is it for me--{end}

Heh heh ...
Wow ...
I've been killed.{end}

Damn ...!
What have I
been doing--?{end}

Damn it!
We couldn't do it!{end}

Have I come
of age already ...{end}

Gaahh--!
All my training was
still not enough!{end}

Aahhh--!
Someone, help me!{end}

Escape to the north!
We'll take care
of the Imperial Army.{end}

P, please!{end}

Aahhh--!{end}

Ahh--!{end}

Nooo!
S, stop it!{end}

M, Mummy ...{end}

What are you doing?
Are you crazy!?
Someone, help me!{end}

Ahhh ...
Is something
bothering you ...?{end}

I haven't been
at peace since losing
His Majesty.{06}{07}
But I am an
Imperial General and
I will crush you!{end}

Be glad.
Not everyone gets to
die by my hand.{end}

Fucker!
How dare you
oppose me!{end}

Gaaahhh--!{06}{07}
I wanted to die somewhere ...
that matched my beauty ...
Not in this worthless village.{end}

Retreat!{end}

Retreat!{end}

Is it over yet ...?{end}

Thank you.
They ...
They nearly killed me.{end}

To show our gratitude, we'd
like you to have our
village heirloom, this crown.{end}

Obtained Crown.{end}

Thanks!
I'll treasure it.{end}

You probably
need to use the
ships too, right?{06}{07}
It's not much, but
we'll lend them to you.
Make good use of them.{end}

Imelda's troops ...
are committing atrocities ...{end}

Hurry, {02}!
To Velzeria!{end}

You probably
need to use the
ships too, right?{06}{07}
It's not much, but
we'll lend them to you.
Make good use of them.{end}

Thank you.{06}{07}
All right,
hurry up, everyone!{06}{07}
The Empire won't act
unopposed any more.
It's got us to deal with.{end}

Don't ambush the villagers!
We need to disrupt
our pursuers first!{end}

Hee hee hee.
Leave it to me!{end}

Long live
the Empire!{end}

Lady Imelda!{end}

Heh heh heh.
I'll slaughter anyone who
can't run fast enough!{end}

Hee hee hee!
I seem to have a few
cuts and bruises ...{end}

I, I didn't
expect this to ...{end}

Die, die, die!
Uha hah hah!{end}

Gaahhh!{end}

General ...
I'm ... finished ...{end}

Arrgghh!
Why ... why--?{end}

Ughh ... gahh--!{end}

H, how
foolish of me ...{end}

Don't give up!
Now is the
time to counterattack!{end}

Lady Imelda,
m, my apolog--{end}

Damn it!
It's too late!{end}

Hah hah hah!{06}{07}
You won't have access
to the boats any more.{06}{07}
Your hope dies here!
Your feet are worthless,
you'll never make it in time!{06}{07}
Hah hah hah!{end}

Bernhardt is
already dead!{06}{07}
There's no point
in fighting!{end}

Haven't I told you?{06}{07}
Alhazard's revival
was His Majesty's
last request!{end}

What?
Why would the Kaiser
want Alhazard unsealed?{end}

D, don't ask me that ...{end}

The outcome has
been decided!
This war has no purpose!{end}

Hah.
You really don't
understand, do you?{06}{07}
Our Empire is one
of conviction. Its followers
will always gratefully
offer their lives.{06}{07}
And I won't shame
it, myself, or my men
by giving in to some
redheaded upstart!{end}

Fuck!
Have they already
caught up!?{end}

Thank you.{06}{07}
Y, you saved my life.
Please, use my boat.{06}{07}
It's not much, but I
will also pray to the Goddess
for your safe journey.{end}

This is terrible!
Let's help the
villagers at once!{end}
