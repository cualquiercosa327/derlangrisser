Ancient Lord of Darkness!
My God, Chaos, hear my plea!
Enrapture me with your power!{end}

N, nothing ...{end}

Why? Why hasn't Chaos
answered my prayer!{06}{07}
It probably has to do with
this disgusting human blood
flowing in my veins!{end}

{font3}Sonya ...
What is it you want
with his holiness, Chaos?{end}

Argh! I won't give up until
Chaos returns and brings
death to this unfair world!{end}

{font3}...{06}{07}
{font3}Our god would
never answer a vile
being with human taint
such as you!{end}

Damn it all ...{06}{07}
Why, why did Father have to
choose a human as my mother!?{06}{07}
The word "human" seems
to haunt my whole life!{end}

Sonya, please
don't do it!{end}

{font3}Damn!
It's those humans!{end}

Sonya, when you summon
Chaos, what do you plan to do?{end}

Shut up, you wretched bitch!
You betrayed B{3a}ser for
your worthless human friends!{end}

That's not true! B{3a}ser was
controlling her with a spell.{06}{07}
Once B{3a}ser was slain,
the spell was lifted and
she regained her true self.
She betrayed no one.{end}

Either way, it's
the same result!{06}{07}
I'll avenge the
Prince of Darkness!{end}

Calm down, Sonya.
We don't have
to fight like this.{06}{07}
We are trying to rid El Sallia
of wars, for the sake of peace!
You can come with us!{end}

You have no right 
to call me by name,
you scheming human.{06}{07}
Your so-called peace has no
place for the Demon Tribe,
much less half-breeds like me!{end}

{font3}Sonya ... we will ...
assist you in
killing the humans.{end}

Humans, Demons ...{06}{07}
No one wants me.
A life of pain and death is
all I will ever have.{end}

Sonya, ... must you fight!?
If not for yourself, stop for
Rohga. He loved you!{06}{07}
Damn, it's useless! 
This leaves a bitter
taste in my heart ...{end}

Humans, humans,
humans, humans!{06}{07}
I wish you all 
would just die!{end}

A face on the wall
begins speaking.{06}{07}

"Would you,
Knowing what's in store,"{06}{07}

"Memory relegated to lore,
Choose this life once more?"{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

"Really ...,
well in that case ..."{06}{07}

The face on the
wall fell silent.{end}

Let's go!{end}

We can't allow Chaos
to return to our world!{end}

Don't touch me!{06}{07}
Descendants of Light, my ass!
You allow prejudice and hate,
but say you want peace?
Descend to your graves!{end}

Th, this is the end ...{end}

Gah--!{end}

I'm so, so tired ...{end}

I'm beat ...{end}

Shit, what
a dreadful mistake ...
I must fall back!{end}

Damn.
I should have
practised more ...{end}

{02} ...
I'm sorry,
I'll have to fall back{end}

Cough ... Damn! 
I'll be back,
don't you worry ...{end}

The ... the sky ...
It's so--{end}

Grant me power!
I want power to destroy the
humans once and for all!{end}

Aah!{end}

Sonya!{end}

Ugh ...{end}

Sonya!{end}

Try not to move ...
You might injure yourself
further. Are you okay?{end}

Hah, ... you're showing ...
me mercy before I die.{06}{07}
Why, why are you 
kind to me now ...?{06}{07}
I thought all humans were
backstabbing, double-crossing--
hateful and racist scum ...!{06}{07}
I thought to myself, "These
cruel, heartless people, ... 
I can easily kill them all!"{06}{07}
Hah, ... I guess not all
humans are so twisted and
evil ... after all.{end}

Sonya!
Don't die on us!
Please!{end}

It was nice to see
this side of humans
before my death.{06}{07}
So warm, ... your hand.
I can ... be proud of ... 
my human blood ... after all.{06}{07}
Rohga, I'll be
with you soon ...{end}

Sonya!? What are you saying?
No! Please, let her live!{end}

...{end}

This world has
wronged Sonya ...{06}{07}
She deserved a better life.
How .. how heartbreaking.{end}

Sonya ... so sad ...
Why ...{end}

Argh ...{end}

Chaos ... Why ...
Why ...?{end}

That girl, ... Sonya, wished
for nothing more than
to be surrounded by love.{06}{07}
While she said she
despised everyone, inside
she honestly felt lonely. {end}

...{end}

But, we humans have
to answer for that. {06}{07}
If humans didn't
persecute that girl ...
If we had showed her
some understanding ...{end}

Sonya ... so sad ...{end}

This war is merciless ...
Tragedies like these are why
I choose to wield Langrisser!{06}{07}
The next generation should
not know such suffering.
Let us put an end to this
war-torn, tear-filled era!{end}

{font3}Grrrrrr ...!{end}

{font3}Aaahhh ...!{end}

{font3}Arghh--!{end}

{font3}Die, fools!
How dare you
defile our temple!{end}

{font3}How could I lose
to a mere human...?{end}

{font3}...{end}

{font3}...!{end}

{font3}...!{end}

{font3}Gaahh--!{end}

{font3}Aaahh--!{end}

{font3}Aahhh!{end}

{font3}Aarrghhh!{end}

{font3}...{end}

{font3}...{end}
