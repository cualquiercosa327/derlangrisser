Hmmm ...?
This village ...{06}{07}
I see. It's been a while since
I've been back, hasn't it ...{end}

Help!
Somebody, help!{end}

{font3}Waooooon!{end}

Aaahh ...
Somebody ... help--!{end}

Eeek!{end}

Why are they doing this ...?{end}

Have you already forgotten?{06}{07}
That's what I despise
about you humans!
You're so selfish!{06}{07}
All of you, go kill as
many as you like!{end}

{font3}Grrrrr!{end}

Not again!
I'm starting to think
we should avoid villages ...{06}{07}
{02}, a group of
monsters is attacking!{end}

I've never seen such
a huge horde of monsters ...{06}{07}
What the ...?
That girl, ...
she seems to be working
on the side of the monsters.{end}

Huh?
Here come some
tougher humans!{06}{07}
I'm tired of killing humans
who don't put up a fight.
Let's have some fun with them!{end}

...?{06}{07}
I sense something more
than demon tribe in her ...{end}

...?
Impossible ...! Could she be ...?{end}

...?{06}{07}
Rohga, what's the matter?{end}

Oh, ... it's nothing.{end}

Anyway, we must
protect the villagers!{end}

Yeah!{end}

Let's go, everyone!
Crush them!{end}

Come forth,
those who share my blood!{end}

{font3}Lady Sonya, you called?{end}

Sonya!?
I knew it, Sonya!{06}{07}
Sonya!
It's me, Rohga!
Have you forgotten me?{end}

...{end}

{02}, I have
a request ...{end}

...?
What's wrong?{end}

That girl commanding
the monsters, I think she's
my younger sister ...{end}

What!?{end}

I need to be sure.
Let me get close to her.{end}

It's dangerous.
Are you sure?{end}

Please ...{end}

I understand.
I'll try to get you as
close as I can.{end}

{02}, correct?
Let me lend you a hand.{end}

The Imperials want
to help us?
What are they up to?{end}

I'm not sure, but that
Leon appears to be an
honourable man.{06}{07}
We can trust him.{end}

I agree.{06}{07}
The Blue Dragon Knights are
formed from the best
soldiers in the Empire.{06}{07}
They're not just strong, but
truly honourable as well.{end}

Hmmm ...,
is that so ...{end}

I see ...
Sorry about before. Please
lend us your strength!{end}

Rohga, was she
really your sister?{end}

Yeah, ...
I'm positive.{06}{07}
But why is she doing this ...?
I can't believe Sonya
could ever kill someone ...{end}

Then she must be someone
else with the same name!{end}

Are you sure you're
not mistaken?{end}

Could I mistake my own
sister for someone else?{06}{07}
Sonya's father was a
man of the demon tribe.
She had always been
shunned for that.{end}

Is that why she has a
grudge against humans?{06}{07}
How sad it is, being unable
to trust people ...{end}

Then does Sonya have a
grudge against these people?{end}

That's right.
This is the village where
Sonya and I were brought up.{end}

What was so terrible that
these people did to her?{end}

I don't know, but she
seems to truly despise them
for some reason.{end}

I don't know exactly.{06}{07}
While I was out of the
village on work, she left.{06}{07}
But I never thought we'd
meet again like this ...{end}

Her heart is full of
hatred for people now.{06}{07}
Let's do what we can ...
It's still too early to give up.{end}

Sorry, I really appreciate this.{end}

Nothing found in the drawers.{end}

In a forest there are
mushrooms with an odd odour.{end}

Will you try to eat them?{end}

AT raised by 1 point.{end}

Ugh ...
I've come so far ...{end}

Argh!{06}{07}
I would've used all my
power if I'd known these
monsters were this tough.{end}

Hah, ... sorry, I'm beaten ...{end}

Sonya!
You're Sonya, aren't you!?{end}

Brother!{end}

Why are you trying to
kill these villagers?{06}{07}
I have to stop you
by any means, ...
even if I have to use force!{end}

What are you doing!?{06}{07}
These people have to die!
What do you think they did
to me while you were gone!?{06}{07}
I knew it, no one believes
anything I say!
Even my own brother ...{06}{07}
I hate humans!{end}

Shit!
To be defeated here ...
Sonya ...{end}

Crap!
Although Sonya is here
before my eyes ...!{end}

Damn!
How could I make
such a mistake!{end}

God damn it!
These monsters are
quite strong!{end}

{02} ...
I'm sorry ...{end}

Eeek!
Help!{end}

Ouch ...
Why me ...?{end}

No!
Stop it!{end}

Eeek!{end}

My vision is blurry.
Haven't I recovered from
that last wound?{06}{07}
I guess fighting that
dragon by myself was a really
bad idea, after all ...{06}{07}
But helping the villagers
is my top priority now.
I cannot rest.{end}

Let's go, Laird!
We must defeat all the
undead monsters.{end}

Please, wait!
You were wounded in your
recent battle with the monsters.{06}{07}
Are you well enough to fight?{end}

The wound I received
while fighting that dragon ...{end}

Such a great wound would
kill an ordinary man!{06}{07}
Please don't push yourself
by fighting too much.{06}{07}
It would be devastating
to the Blue Dragon Knights
if you died here ...{end}

Hah hah, ... sorry.
You need not worry.{06}{07}
We're just soldiers,
here for the
villagers' protection.{06}{07}
Now is the time to
think of their lives
rather than our own!{end}

What are you saying!?
Fighting with such a wound ...{end}

I'm right behind you, Leon!{06}{07}
Let's drive away
those monsters!{end}

I didn't imagine those monsters
could be so powerful!
We've no choice but to retreat.{end}

{font3}You will die here.{end}

{font3}Impossible ...{end}

{font3}Grrraaahhh!{end}

{font3}Grrraaahhh!{end}

{font3}L, Lady Sonya ...{end}

{font3}Grrrr ...{end}

{font3}Grrrr ...{end}

{font3}How could you, human ...{end}

Who the hell are you!?{06}{07}
You humans
are challenging us!?{06}{07}
Damn you!
Damn you, you mean,
powerless ... humans!{end}

Ah ... I sense a dark, cold
feeling pouring in ...{end}

Ugh!
How could I let a
human defeat me ...{06}{07}
I will have my revenge ...{end}

Sonya!{end}

She's gone.{end}

Hah hah hah ...
Enjoy the pain.{06}{07}
You humans are not
qualified to live on this earth.{end}

Hmph ...
I guess I still haven't
fully recovered ...{end}

Then I will go, too.{06}{07}
{02} saved my life.
I haven't yet
returned the favour.{end}

I'm going too.{06}{07}
It's true that my
sister, Sonya, cooperates
with the Empire.{06}{07}
As long as the Imperial Army
exists, I can see her again.{06}{07}
Anyway, I can't just
let her act like that.
No one but me seems to
be able to stop Sonya.{06}{07}
Even if the only solution
is to kill her ...{end}

We should hurry, too.
It's still quite a long
way to Baldea.{end}

{02}, I'm sorry,
but I will go with Leon.
I know how Sonya feels ...{06}{07}
As long as the Imperial Army
exists, I can see her again.{06}{07}
Anyway, I can't just
let her act like that.
No one but me seems to
be able to stop Sonya.{06}{07}
Even if the only solution
is to kill her ...{end}

Leon!
Do me a favour.
Let me go with you!{end}

My name is Rohga.{06}{07}
As a general of
the Empire, you've probably
heard that name before.{end}

Thanks, I will surely be
a great help to you!{end}

Yes ...
He was my father's
best friend.{06}{07}
I heard he died
about ten years ago.{06}{07}
I haven't had the chance to
visit his grave since then.{end}

Sonya!
What the hell was that?{06}{07}
Gentle Sonya
couldn't do this!{06}{07}
Why ...?
Damn!{end}

Excellent work, {02}.
Though you're an enemy,
I commend you.{end}

Thanks.
I'm grateful.{end}

No, you don't need to thank me.{06}{07}
As leader of the Blue Dragon
Knights, I just could not
stand what she was doing.{end}

I understand.
By the way, how is your wound?{end}

You're a strange man
indeed to worry about
an enemy's wound.{end}

Leon ..., I have a
question for you.{end}

Ask.{end}

Why would a man like you, a
man who hates these empty,
pointless wars, join the army?{06}{07}
You know that war only
brings sadness, don't you?{end}

I can't stand it.
Seeing women and children
sacrificed on the battlefield ...{06}{07}
Someone has to take action to
rid the world of war.
If you hope for peace from the
sidelines, it will never come.{06}{07}
The only way war will ever
end is when the continent
is unified under one man ...
Even through bloody conquest.{06}{07}
Surely it might not be
called true peace ...
But it must be better than
this war-torn age.{end}

I'm not saying that
you're wrong, ...
but it's not so simple.{06}{07}
I don't think there's
such a thing as good or
evil in war.{end}

You and I have had different
ideas from the beginning,
but remember my words!{06}{07}
For all your good intent,
you yourself have sent
countless Imperial soldiers
to their graves.{06}{07}
We are not the only
ones who have created
orphans by this war.{end}

Farewell, {02}!{end}

That's one way of looking at it.{end}

{02} ...!
One man's strength alone can't
rid this continent of war.{06}{07}
The unity of El Sallia
under a strong state could
stop this pointless bloodshed.{06}{07}
What do you think?
Will you join my side in
ending this war-torn era?{end}

Will you join Leon's side?{end}

Surely the world will know
peace under the rule of a
single, strong nation ...{end}

Everyone, ...{06}{07}
Here I must say farewell.
I'm going with Leon.{end}

What!?
{02}, are you leaving
us to join the Empire?{end}

Yes.{06}{07}
The best way to calm
this war-shattered world
is to unify it under a
strong, central nation.{06}{07}
The Empire has the
power to do that.{06}{07}
Moreover, Leon doesn't
seem like a man who fights
for greed or self-interest.{06}{07}
I'll lend the Empire
my strength.{end}

Wait, {02}!{06}{07}
{02} ...{06}{07}
What have you seen in your
years of wandering ...?{06}{07}
What has the Empire
brought to the continent?{06}{07}
Leon already said the Empire
has joined hands with darkness.
The path to true peace
cannot be tainted by evil ...{06}{07}
Please ...!
I beg you to reconsider ...{end}

Will you fight on Leon's
side against Liana's wishes?{end}

...{06}{07}
I've seen the Empire,
and while it may leave much
to be desired, it has shown
me one thing ...{06}{07}
You cannot reshape
the world without controlling
unstoppable power.{06}{07}
Power is necessary to create
a peaceful world ...
Try to understand me, Liana ...{end}

I cannot understand this!{06}{07}
The Empire has shattered
many lives on this quest for
its so-called "peace."{06}{07}
Force brings only sadness!
Besides, Alhazard can't be
controlled by human beings!{end}

...
You are wrong, Liana.{06}{07}
Your diplomacy can do
nothing to end hate and greed.
Force cannot end them either,
but it can bring order.{06}{07}
In a world with order,
people may finally find peace.
I will realise this world ...
I promise ...{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
One day ...
One day you will be able to
understand what I mean.{06}{07}
I'm sure of it ...{end}

Hmmm ...
You may be right.{06}{07}
Real peace isn't about
using power to subdue war.{06}{07}
Until people learn how to
understand each other and
forgive, all the hate and chaos
will never truly end.{end}

I'm sorry, Leon ...
but she is right.
I cannot go with you.{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
Would you really
force us to become
your enemies?{06}{07}
I ...{06}{07}
I never imagined I would
have to fight against you ...{end}

Cherie ...{end}

Hmph!
What a sack of shit you
turned out to be!{06}{07}
I can't believe Lady Jessica
put her faith in you,
but I guess being on
Egbert's side fits you better!{06}{07}
Later.{end}

{02} ...
It seems I have misjudged
your character.{06}{07}
When you aided us at
Castle Kalxath, you did not
seem one who would overlook
the essence of peace ...{06}{07}
And the princess ...
What a cruel twist of fate
this has been.{end}

Everyone ...{end}

Tell me, Leon, what is
our next objective?{end}

We must obtain Langrisser.
The revival of Alhazard
mustn't be disturbed.{end}

Laird!{06}{07}
I leave you in charge of
the Blue Dragon Knights.
Take them and seek
out Castle Baldea.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Have Laird go first to look
for Castle Baldea.{end}

Good idea ...{end}

It must be this village ...{end}

"The Holy Priest,
Ikreuz, rests here ..."{06}{07}
I knew it would be here.{end}

You knew Ikreuz?{end}

I see ...{end}

Yes ...
He was a nice, gentle man.{end}

Yeah ...{end}

Were you an
acquaintance of his?{end}

I see.{end}

We're working together
from now on.
You've requested it.{end}

Leon joins the entourage!{end}

It's time to depart.{end}

Yes.
Let's go to Castle Baldea.{end}

Bye, {02}.{end}

Bye, {02}.{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
Today we met as friends,
but that changes nothing.
When next we meet,
it shall be as enemies.{end}

Yeah ...{end}

What a shame ...{06}{07}
You have incredible potential.
I would have liked to
call such a man my comrade.{06}{07}
Farewell, {02}!{end}

He's gone ...{end}

We can't just stay here.
Let's go to Baldea!{end}

You've helped us, and we
must thank you somehow.
Please, take this.{end}

{02} was handed 300P!{end}

We've got trouble!
It's the Blue Dragon Knights!{end}

Leon and Laird?
At a time like this ...{end}

What!?
Leon?{end}

General Leon!
The enemy's here.{end}

Yes.{06}{07}
I came here only because
something seemed amiss ...
I didn't expect to meet them
in a place like this ... {end}

Crap!
Isn't that Leon of the
Blue Dragon Knights?{end}

If you collaborate with the
Empire, then don't do
anything to disgrace its name!{end}

Shut up!
Stop commanding me!{end}

Troublesome girl ...{end}

General Leon, this
is in our favour.{06}{07}
Let's avenge our last
conflict by helping the girl
of the demon tribe!{end}

Laird ...
Have you forgotten the
Code of Chivalry?{06}{07}
Why would we attack
people who protect
helpless villagers?{06}{07}
In the name of the
Blue Dragon Knights, I can't
drag innocent
people into our war.{end}

But, General Leon, 
we of the Empire are allied
with the demon tribe.{06}{07}
It's not a good idea to
fight against them.{end}

I don't care!
I'll take all responsibility!{end}

{02}, was it?
So you're the ones who
protected the villagers.{end}

Yes, that's right.{end}

That girl leading
the monsters is an ally
of the Empire.{end}

So you're going to take
revenge on us for her?{end}

No, I want to express
my gratitude.{06}{07}
We have no intentions of
killing helpless people.
I would have stopped her
if you hadn't.{end}

I see ...
Do as you like.{end}

You're a mercenary?
What is your name?{end}

So, you're Rohga?
I've heard that you're a
skilful mercenary.{06}{07}
Okay, you have permission.
I'll be glad to have you with us.{end}

Stop it, Sonya!{end}

Who's calling my name?{end}

Have you forgotten
what I look like?{end}

My brother ...
My brother Rohga!?{end}

Sonya, it's you after all!?{06}{07}
It's important you
stop attacking the
villagers right now!{end}

Why?
Why should I stop?{06}{07}
Brother, you too are
on the humans' side ...{end}

I've been searching for
you for a long time.
I ...{end}

I knew it!
Brother, you're too human!{end}

Sonya!{end}

I want all humans
to be destroyed!{06}{07}
I'll never, ever
forgive your kind!{end}

Sonya!
Wait, Sonya!{end}

She's gone.{end}

Sonya!
Stop killing the villagers.
I'll kill you if you don't stop!{end}

Stop commanding me, brother.
I've heard enough!{end}
