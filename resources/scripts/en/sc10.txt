Good morning!
Did everyone sleep
well yesterday?{end}

I slept like the dead.{end}

Yes, I managed to get a good
rest during the night.{end}

I ask that you leave
Lady Liana's safety to me.{06}{07}
Even the Imperial Army
would be quite unlikely to
attack our shrine.{end}

Thank you.
Have you any idea why the
Imperials are after Liana?{06}{07}
Does it have anything to
do with her work as a
Shrine Maiden of Light?{end}

...{06}{07}
Perhaps ...
Their goals are, as
of yet, unclear to me.{end}

There must be something
special about Liana that the
Blue Dragon Knights seek.{end}

Great Priest!
We're in trouble!
The Imperial Army has arrived!{end}

What--!?{end}

Soldier, what business have
you on this holy ground?{end}

I am Colonel Zorum of the
Blazing Dragon Army, the
right hand of General Vargas.{06}{07}
Would you be so kind
as to hand over the tablet
your shrine is guarding?{end}

I've heard the Empire
seeks the tablet to break
the seal of Alhazard ...{06}{07}
If this is true, then
I must refuse.
The release of Alhazard's
power would destroy the world!{end}

In that case, we'll just be
confiscating the tablet, then!{end}

Phooey, you can have the old
man and the others, Zorum.{06}{07}
I'm just here to have fun
with little maidens!
Hee hee hee ...{06}{07}
Hmmm ...?{end}

This isn't good ...{end}

That blond girl seems
somewhat familiar ...{06}{07}
Oh! I remember now!
If I'm not mistaken, she's the
one General Leon's
Blue Dragon Knights are after!{06}{07}
How convenient! Since we're
here, let's grab her too.
Gwa ha ha ha ...{end}

It seems we can
never get a break ...{06}{07}
Colonel Zorum is one of the
Blazing Dragon Army's best.
He's even called the right hand
of General Vargas.{06}{07}
Morgan isn't a nobody either ...
He's an elite black magician
of the Dark Dragon Sorcerers.{06}{07}
Even alone, either of them
would be a challenge.{end}

Liana, listen carefully.
No matter what happens,
don't leave the shrine!{end}

If that is
what you wish ...{end}

Let's go, Morgan.
We'll take them out
in one strike!{end}

Let's not, meat for brains,
and "Morgan" alone
isn't enough.{06}{07}
You will refer to me as
"Commander Morgan!"{end}

Oh no, I won't! This time,
I'll be the one commanding.{06}{07}
And I'll call you
whatever I please!{06}{07}
If you hate being addressed
without a title, maybe I can
find one more fitting, like
"Widdle Morgan."{end}

Bah! You annoying,
ox-sized numb skull!{end}

What was that!?{06}{07}
I don't need to take such
insults from a demented
pervert with a Lolita complex!{end}

Y, you ...
Damn you!{end}

Sigh ...
It appears teamwork isn't
their strong suit ...{end}

Stop idling about!{06}{07}
I don't care what you are or
what you want to be called!
I said attack, so attack!{end}

Our enemies are probably
planning to use elves.{06}{07}
Elves are excellent bowmen
capable of long-range
attacks. We'll need to
be careful in our approach.{end}

Elves have rather weak
defence, don't they?{end}

Yes. We can use that to our
advantage and quickly take
them down with a direct attack.{end}

Hmmm, ...
their direct attack power
is rather low as well, isn't it?{end}

Yes, that's correct.{06}{07}
Really, any unit with high
defence should have no
problems dealing with them
in close quarters.{end}

Is that so ...{06}{07}
Then as long as we can
avoid their range attacks,
there's nothing to fear.{end}

Sir Scott sounds like a master
strategist, doesn't he?{end}

You're too kind,
I'm still just a student.{06}{07}
My father has drummed tactics
into me my entire life.
Sometimes, I felt as though my
brains would burst.{end}

These guys are a
stubborn bunch!{end}

Hee hee hee!
Thank you, I consider
that a compliment!{end}

God, you've got to be the most
bothersome ass I've ever been
assigned to work with.{end}

Look who's talking,
you gibbering,
dunder-headed cretin!{end}

Looks like this "stubborn"
group bit off more than
they could chew!{06}{07}
You can't back out now!{end}

You're not
doing much better!{end}

Ack!
What's taking him so long!?{06}{07}
Hey, "Mister Commander!"
Get the lead out and start
killing these guys!{end}

Our troops are so caught up
in blood lust they don't want
to bother with these weaklings.{06}{07}
While I'm in charge of
this unit, I won't forgive
such arrogance!{end}

Damn you!{06}{07}
You--thick-skulled, overrated,
blundering, nancy boy!
Who in the hell would respect
orders from you!?{end}

Man ...
You have an amazing
eye for battle ...{end}

Is that so?
I didn't realise you were
one to give compliments.{end}

I would have handled
this strategy differently ...
Do you have any orders for me?{06}{07}
I was originally a mercenary,
so taking orders is a great
chance for me to see just what
commanding skills you have.{06}{07}
So tell me, boss,
what's the plan?{end}

An interesting idea ...!
Well then, I'll show
you the way we fight.{end}

If it's decided, then order away!{end}

Rohga joins the entourage!{end}

Everyone, be careful!{06}{07}
Although Kalxath has won
a few battles against the
Imperial Army, this one
won't be easy.{end}

We're in trouble, {02}!
The Imperial Army is
launching an ambush!{end}

Ha ha ha!
Now that is what we call
a "strategy!"{06}{07}
Go forth, men!
Fetch us that tablet!{end}

Everyone, stop them!
Don't let a single Imperial
soldier into the shrine!{end}

I'll try my best!{end}

It's an ambush!
Don't let any Imperial soldiers
into the shrine!{end}

In moving through the forest,
you spot a small clearing.{06}{07}

At the centre, one spot
is lit by rays of sunlight.{end}

Do you want to
try digging here?{end}

Obtained Swift Boots.{end}

That's as far as you go!{end}

Shit ...
I never expected
this to happen--!{end}

Don't go easy on me!{end}

Argh!
I can't do any more than this ...
I'm sorry, {02}--!{end}

Witness my superior attack!{end}

I'm sorry.
I have to retire
from the field ...{end}

Eeek!{end}

Argh ... {02}--!{end}

It can't be ... can't be that--!{end}

Well then, my teenage
sweetie, I command you to
kill that red-haired guy!{end}

Stop, Liana!
Don't you recognise me!?{end}

Mwa ha ha!
It's useless!
Why don't you just surrender!{end}

I ... must obey ...{end}

Argh ... {02}--!{end}

Mwa ha ha!
Die, die!
Diiiiiieeeeee!!{end}

Damn it!
The Maiden of Light is ...!{end}

It can't be ... can't be that ...{06}{07}
Liana ...
Gahh--!{end}

Within Liana was the potential
to save or destroy El Sallia.{06}{07}
Unfortunately, her death
shattered the seal on Alhazard
for all time without another
Maiden of Light to repair it.{06}{07}
The Rayguard Empire used
the evil sword's power to
mobilise its entire army, but in
the end they met with ruin.{06}{07}
Now, the dream of a unified
continent is long dead,
as chaos and death rule
and hope fades away.{06}{07}
After many generations,
El Sallia became known as the
land of the eternally damned ...{end}

Ahh--!{06}{07}
Huh!? I ... was ...
I was being controlled ...?
Everyone ...
I'm sor ... ry--!{end}

Wah ha ha!
Oh, what a lovely
turn of events!{06}{07}
My sincere gratitude
to you all!
You just saved us
a great deal of time!{end}

Damn it!
We should have taken
out that guy first--!{end}

What's this? 
How crude! At least I got
a free night's stay ...{06}{07}
I guess if you really need
it, I'll do you all a favour
by helping out.{end}

If it's such a bother, then don't
trouble yourself! You can stay
on the sidelines and watch.{end}

Sounds interesting!
Then I accept your offer
to observe your skills.{end}

Well, what should
I do, {02}?{end}

Hah!{end}

What an unskilled piece of shit!
Damn ... why did I trust
a guy like you to command me!?{end}

My power was said to have
been that strong--!{end}

Cherie of Kalxath, heading out!{end}

Cherie ...?
I think maybe I've met her
somewhere before ...{end}

It looks like I've become
entangled in this battle, too.{06}{07}
I'll protect one of the shrine's
entrances. Please leave
Lady Liana's protection to me.{end}

Okay, thanks.{end}

So, what should I do?{end}

Protect the right entrance{end}

Protect the left entrance{end}

Stay where you are{end}

Can you protect the right
entrance for me?{end}

Okay.{end}

Can you protect the left
entrance for us?{end}

Not a problem.{end}

Please stay and protect the
centre entrance.{end}

I got it.{end}

I've never cared much
for the Imperial Army!{end}

I guess I overdid it ...
I need to take a rest ...{end}

Maidens, take refuge in
the shrine's interior!{end}

Yes, Priest!{end}

Oooh ... Lushiris--!{end}

Priest!{end}

Liana!
She looks so cold ... but this is
no time to ponder. Come on!{end}

Y, yes ...{end}

Aah, Goddess Lushiris--!{end}

Gahh!{end}

Mmmm ...
Raw, warm blood tastes as
good as I always imagined ...{end}

I'll grant no mercy to those
who obstruct my path!{end}

I'll show you how
we get things done!{end}

Im, impossible!
My power ...
inferior to yours--!{06}{07}
I won't forget this!{end}

Which should I take?
One is enough to start with.{06}{07}
Oh yes ...
I just remembered an
interesting magical item
General Egbert gave me ...{06}{07}
Maybe I should try it out
on the cute little girl!
Hee hee hee!{06}{07}
I call thee forth, spirit that
enslaves both mind and soul--!{06}{07}
...?
Oh shit ... I forgot what comes
after that part--oh well.{06}{07}
{font4}Mod Faegriast Aemettig!{end}

Ahh!
My ... My head--!{end}

Liana!
Are you all right!?{end}

Excellent, my teenage sweetie.
First off, sacrifice redhead
hero-boy over there to Odin!{end}

Yes ...
Widdle Morgan ...{end}

How odd ...
It seems my magic
didn't work quite right.{06}{07}
Someone throw me a bone!
Why can't anything
ever go the way I plan!?{end}

Gah ha ha ha!
Morgan, you're one pathetic
excuse for a sorcerer.{end}

D, damn it!
A meat-head grunt like you
has no right to say that!{end}

Meat head?
Maybe I should find a bit more
humiliating work for you ...{06}{07}
...
"Widdle Morgan."{end}

You son of a bitch!
Well ... that's all right.{06}{07}
Seeing you cower in the
back like that is satisfactory
enough, "Commander Zorum."
Hee hee hee!{end}

What's wrong!?
Be strong, Liana!{end}

It's no use ...{06}{07}
His magic has overcome
her true self and is
manipulating her mind.{06}{07}
What should we do?{end}

That man ...
We must defeat Morgan!{06}{07}
If we do that, I'm sure Liana
will return to normal.{end}

Yeah ...
If we somehow defeat Morgan,
I'm sure it will break the spell!{end}

Mwa ha ha ha!
You think you can beat me
with your weak spirit?{06}{07}
Well, if you want to become a
zombie, then I'll grant your
wish right away. I could always
use a few more minions!{end}

Wee hee hee!
Those who oppose me will die!{end}

Taste the height of my power!{end}

Damn it!
Y, you actually injured me!{06}{07}
Some day I'll make
you regret this!
Just wait till I have
my revenge!{end}

Ah--!?{06}{07}
Hmmm ...
I ... I ...{end}

Are you awake again?
With Morgan wounded, his
spell seems to have lost effect.{end}

I'm sorry, {02}.{end}

Im, impossible--!{end}

Gah--!{end}

Wa ha ha!
I won't leave anyone standing!{end}

Die!{end}

But ... it was ... perfect ...
I... gave it my--!{end}

I failed!
Colonel Zorum, I'm sorry.{end}

Heh heh heh ...
Let's go.{end}

Heh heh heh ...
Die!{end}

Not yet,
I can't die yet--!{end}

Outrageous ...{end}

Blood... blood is--!{end}

It looks like the battle is over.{end}

Thanks for helping out.
I'm {02}. May I ask
your name, Lady ...?{end}

I'm Cherie of Kalxath.
It's a pleasure to meet you.{06}{07}
Our kingdom and its
neighbours are forming a
League of Anti-Imperialists.{06}{07}
I heard there was Imperial
activity in Estool, so I came to
see if I could help.{06}{07}
However, the Empire was only
after the Shrine of Light ...
I wonder ... what were
they planning?{end}

Ow, ow--!{end}

Are you all right?
Umm ...{end}

How shameful to have been
beaten like that ...
I'm Cherie of Kalxath.{06}{07}
Our kingdom and its
neighbours are forming a
League of Anti-Imperialists.{06}{07}
I heard there was Imperial
activity in Estool, so I came to
see if I could help.{06}{07}
However, the Empire was only
after the Shrine of Light ...
I wonder ... what were
they thinking?{end}

I let myself be
controlled by Morgan
and betrayed {02}.{06}{07}
{02}, if,
if you had died ...
I ... I--!{end}

You needn't fret.
We all came out safe, so there's
nothing to be sorry about.{06}{07}
Besides ... you look
better with a smile.
So don't cry.{end}

Thank you ...{06}{07}
Oh, {02} ...
It seems I cause you nothing
but trouble. I'm so sorry ...{06}{07}
But ... I'll try to look happier.
Please don't worry about me.{end}

That's the spirit!{end}

Okay.{end}

I'm sorry ...{06}{07}
If it had gone on any
longer, I would have
attacked everyone here.{end}

Liana, it wasn't your fault.
You were being enslaved
by Morgan's spell.{end}

Thank you everyone ...
for thinking about me ...{end}

By the way, what should
we do about Liana?{end}

Eventually, even the largest
Shrine of Light won't be enough
to keep the Imperials at bay.{end}

So what is your plan?{06}{07}
It doesn't seem safe to
entrust her to a Shrine of Light.{end}

That's rather apparent.
However, I'm not sure what
other options we have ...{end}

{02} ... I, um ...{end}

What is it, Liana?{end}

Please, let me fight too!{end}

No way!
It's too dangerous for a young
lady on the battlefield.{end}

But all of you have
to endure so much ...
just because of me.{06}{07}
It was for my sake ... that ...
that all of you got hurt.{end}

I think we should let her come.
Or do you lack confidence in
your ability to protect her ...?{end}

...{end}

Fine.{end}

Thank you, {02}!{end}

Liana joins the entourage!{end}

Well, that's that. It seems
like everything has worked out.{06}{07}
After that battle, I have to
say, I like your spirit!{end}

Thanks, it's good to
be working with you.{end}

I feel that we'll be
great if we work together.
We'll be rich!{06}{07}
I helped you through this.
Please allow me to continue
working with you, {02}!{end}

It is I who should
be asking you!{06}{07}
We could really use a
sword as strong as yours.{end}

How disappointing!{06}{07}
After all of the great talk
I heard about you,
you're a major let down!{06}{07}
You have good qualities
and real talent, but why don't
you use any of it!?{end}

...{end}

However, I sense that
you'll do great things.
Together we'd be rich!{06}{07}
The problem's that
you're too inexperienced.
Talk with me!
I'll teach you everything!{06}{07}
{02}!
I'll train you to be
a great leader!{06}{07}
But you better damn well
live up to my expectations.
You're going to cost me
a fortune, you know?{end}

Well then, let's
hurry to Kalxath.
I have to tell them of this!{end}

Cherie joins the entourage!{end}

Also, I'd like to give
you all a big welcome.{end}

Wait up a second!
At least, let me thank
you for helping us ...{end}

Thanks to you, the shrine
is safe, but there's not much we
can do for you without trouble.{end}

Please accept this cross.
May it always bring you
Lushiris's blessing.{end}

Obtained Cross.{end}

I can't do anything for you, but
I'll pray for your safe journey.{end}

Well then, let's be off!{end}

Hmmm, well done ...
No matter, though!
Witness my real power!{06}{07}
Everyone, charge!{end}

Argh!
Slow! Slow! Slow!{06}{07}
With a stupid commander
like you, we're not going to
get in a decent attack, much
less win. No way ...{end}

How dishonourable!
They're going after Liana!
Hurry! Go and help her!{end}

Hmph ...
Is that all you can do!?
Don't drag this out!{end}

Ho ho, let's boogie.{end}

The Empire's after
the girl, isn't it?{06}{07}
I see...
If that's so, how about
coming to Castle Kalxath?{end}

Hya ha ha!
How interesting.
Can you still fight like that?{end}

Hya ha ha!
This is too, too sweet!{06}{07}
You dare oppose me,
an Imperial Commander,
with your feeble power?{end}

Hya ha ha!
The Blazing Dragon Army's
strength is unsurpassed!{end}

Wah ha ha!
Be more aggressive!{06}{07}
We'll teach you how foolish
it is to stand against us!{end}

Hold it!{end}

Castle Kalxath ...?{end}

If I remember correctly,
Kalxath just might be able
to protect Liana.{end}

That's right.
Kalxath has many strong
soldiers besides me.{end}

I found you, Imperial slime!
I figured you'd be here
after the situation changed!{06}{07}
I can't let you do as you please!{end}

Ack!
Little girl, go home quietly.{06}{07}
I wouldn't want that sweet ass
of yours to get bruised here.
I have other plans for it ...
Hya hya hya!{end}

Wh, what was that--!?
You dirty wizard!{end}

Yeah, I'm going to have to
side with her on that.
You certainly are twisted.{end}

You ...
Grrr!{end}

Who is that strange girl
who just showed up?{end}

How rude!
Even though I took all the
trouble coming to help you.{end}

Oh ...?
You're pretty cute.{06}{07}
I suppose tough girls
aren't your type.
Should I act a bit more bubbly?{end}

You ... you don't mean me!?
I feel so awkward.{end}

Are you stupid!?
Who was talking to you!{end}

Hey ...!{end}

... 
Anyway, please help us.{end}

Heh heh heh.
I think he's blushing.
How cute!{end}

Damn!
We couldn't protect them ...{end}
