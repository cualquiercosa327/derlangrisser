...{end}

Hmmm ...{end}

A little longer.{end}

...{06}{07}
Grr--!
I can't stand it!{end}

Just ...
A little longer ...{end}

O, oh!{end}

Lord Vargas, congratulations!
You're the father of a baby girl!{end}

O, oh!
Eliza!{end}

Oh!
Such a charming
lass she is!{06}{07}
She'll grow up to be
beautiful, just like Eliza! I'm
the world's luckiest man!{end}

My dear,
might you have some
cloth to wrap her in?{end}

Of course we've got some!
We're here in our
humble, well-stocked home!{end}

Such a happy occasion!{end}

Forgive me, dear.{06}{07}
Didn't you really
want a baby boy?{end}

Yes, ... I did.{end}

But I've thought of a
name for a daughter, too!{end}

My, what name have
you thought of?{end}

How about Emilia?{end}

Emilia ...{06}{07}
Emilia is a good
name for her.{end}

Well, my wee lass,
your name
shall be Emilia.{end}

Emilia, do you understand?
I'm your Papa!{end}

My, I wonder if she
does understand?
It looks like she's smiling ...{end}

General Leon, one
moment please.{end}

Colonel, your service is beyond
measure. Excellent work!
Our goal lies within reach.{end}

Hmmm ... I wonder if
our troubles will
be over so easily.{end}

Speaking of which,
where is Langrisser?{end}

It lies on the
central altar.{end}

Well, let's get
this over with.{end}

...!{06}{07}
This won't be
as simple as you
make it sound!{end}

We didn't come here
just to deliver
Langrisser to you!{end}

What a bother.{end}

General Leon, let's hurry.
We must get the
sword before they do.{end}

Indeed.{06}{07}
According to Egbert,
two other than myself
can draw the sword.{06}{07}
Our strategy must take
them into consideration.{end}

I see.{06}{07}
In any case, let's move.
Time to get Langrisser!{end}

It makes no difference.
Even if Cherie
should come here ...{end}

Please wait
a little longer.{06}{07}
We can't say at this point
whether we've truly lost.{end}

I understand.
Until Cherie comes,
do the best you can.{end}

Leon, you and I are both
Descendants of Light?{end}

Yes, Egbert said something
to that effect. This
sword proves our heritage.{06}{07}
The soldier Dieh{38}rte,
my eastern ancestor, is
said to have brought it
here a century ago.{end}

The blade has a unique design.
I've never seen another like it.{end}

It is what they call a katana.{06}{07}
As a sword for killing,
it has no match.{end}

I see.{06}{07}
All that considered, I
wonder which of us
should approach the altar.{end}

Either of you will do.
Just remember why
we seek the sword.{end}

By offering Langrisser
to His Majesty, we shall forge
a noble, prosperous world.{06}{07}
The whole continent may
join in an era of peace.{end}

Princess, please wait!{end}

Hey!
What's the news
on Langrisser?{end}

The Imperial Army
doesn't have it either.{06}{07}
If you take advantage of
your mobility, you might
make it in time.{06}{07}
I'll support you from here.{06}{07}
Please, go with all haste
to the altar, ...
and return with Langrisser!{end}

Cherie of Kalxath,
heading out!{end}

The Imperial Army
doesn't have it either.{06}{07}
We've still got time.
Everyone, defend the altar!
Don't let Langrisser
fall to the Empire!{end}

Understood!{end}

So, a Dragon Knight
has come ... {06}{07}
Hurry, {02}.
Don't let them take
the sword!{end}

Understood.{end}

Jessica's here ...
Looks like we'd
better hurry.{end}

We're going to win this.
I've got a wife and a
new daughter to honour!{06}{07}
Get ready for a
major ass-kicking!{end}

Vargas re-joins the entourage!{end}

Lady Jessica!{06}{07}
I heard that those who are
not Descendants of Light can't
draw the Holy Blade.{06}{07}
If that's so, let's use all our
power to defeat {02}
before he gets Langrisser.{06}{07}
If we do that, then we can
remove it at our leisure.{end}

No ...{06}{07}
If my memory is clear,
that man, Leon, can
also draw Langrisser.{end}

What? Impossible--!
He's a Descendant of Light?{end}

If that foreign sword he
holds is genuine,
then he's a Descendant.{end}

In that case, we've no
choice but to take Langrisser
before either of them.{end}

That's right.{06}{07}
I'll approach the central
altar. Everyone, please
offer me your support.{end}

Yes, my Lady!{end}

Watch out!
Keith's aerial army
has arrived!{end}

This isn't a good
time to hit them.{06}{07}
Advance slowly until
that girl, Cherie, appears.{end}

Everyone, lend a hand!{06}{07}
We'll be in trouble if
the route to the
altar isn't secure!{06}{07}
If the aerial army blocks us,
Cherie will snatch Langrisser.{end}

...?{06}{07}
A star and a Pegasus ...?
It's rusted so much
it will probably snap.{06}{07}
Might as well take it,
but my mission
has not changed.{end}

Obtained Masayan Sword.{end}

Hmmm ...
So, this is Langrisser.{end}

You really are
another Descendant!{06}{07}
It seems that katana
of yours is the real thing ...{end}

Egbert of the
Dark Dragon Sorcerers
said the same.{06}{07}
"Only a Descendant of Light
can draw the sword ..."{06}{07}
I have inherited this weapon
as generations have before
me. I meet, therefore, the
qualification of Descendant.{end}

You did it, Leon.{06}{07}
The day of one great
Imperial continent will dawn
before our very eyes.{06}{07}
And this new nation will
have no need for war.{end}

The day of one great
Imperial continent will dawn
before our very eyes.{06}{07}
And this new nation will
have no need for war.{end}

So this ...
This is Langrisser!{end}

I didn't make it ...{end}

This weapon is Langrisser,
the Legendary Sword!{end}

Damn it ...!
I can't let Cherie get
ahead of me ...{end}

Langrisser ...
Once more, the world
needs you ...{end}

Shit, I'm too late!
If that girl draws it ...{end}

So that's it ...
That's Langrisser ...!{end}

The Holy Blade, Langrisser ...{06}{07}
With this sword's power,
I can end the
troubles of the world.{end}

So, this is Langrisser.{06}{07}
What could possibly give
it such awesome power?{06}{07}
What? I can't
draw it after all!{end}

So, this is Langrisser.{06}{07}
Damn, what the hell!
Can't budge it!{end}

Hmmm ...
Looks like I can
try to take it.{06}{07}
What the ...?
I can't draw it!{end}

If I use my mystic power,
I'll surely remove it!{06}{07}
No ... Why?
It won't move!{end}

Making it this far is a good
start. Soon, we can turn around
and attack the enemy.{end}

A single beautiful flower
floats on a plank in the waves.
What will you do with it?{end}

Leave it behind{end}

Try to pick it{end}

Remove the plank{end}

The plank was
swallowed by the waves.{end}

You left the
flower behind ...{end}

Inside the flower,
a flower sprite appears.{06}{07}

The flower sprite beams a smile
and disappears into the flower.{06}{07}

AT raised by 3 points!{end}

Out of my way!
I won't let you stand between
me and the altar!{end}

Impossible--!
Langrisser taken before
my very eyes ...{end}

Leave the rest to me!
{02}'s bunch,
get the sword!{end}

I won't back down!{end}

Gaahh--!
Shit!{end}

You're a damned
fool to attack me. You
only live once!{end}

Damn it all!
I leave the rest to you!{end}

Hand over Langrisser
so we can realise our ideal!{end}

Until I have Langrisser,
I cannot accept defeat!{end}

Ugh!
What a magnificent
enemy ...{06}{07}
{02}!
Sorry, but you'll have to
take over from here!{end}

You think you can win
against General Imelda of
the Water Dragon Navy?{end}

Why?
I just don't get it!{end}

I'm unshakable. I'm fearless.
Right now, let's go!{end}

Damn ...
This is getting
out of hand!{end}

General Leon,
what would you
have me do?{06}{07}
Shall I take the offensive
or maintain our defence?{end}

Stand by for now{end}

Clear a path to the altar{end}

It's your decision{end}

As you wish.{06}{07}
I'll stand against the
enemy while you secure
passage into the castle.{end}

Understood.
My troops will secure
a path to the altar.{end}

Leave it up to me.
I'll keep an eye on things, and
fill in where I'm needed.{end}

Uughh--!
To be defeated here
of all places ...{end}

Laird, you've done well.
Fall back for now!{end}

General Leon ...
My apologies.{06}{07}
Next time you call
upon me, I'll do better.{end}

Looks like I'm
the only one left. {06}{07}
Don't worry,
I won't give up!{end}

Since Cherie's been
wounded, all I can do
is take Langrisser.{06}{07}
Everyone, please
help me out!{end}

You're just going to abandon
your destiny? You were
chosen to protect Langrisser!{end}

I don't recall accepting
such a mission!{06}{07}
With Langrisser,
we could end the strife.
We could end the bloodshed.{06}{07}
That's why we must
have that sword.{end}

Please step aside!{end}

You won't get any
farther than this!{end}

P, Princess ...
I apologise ...{end}

That's enough, Keith.
Rest for a little while.{end}

All right ...{end}

No ...
Can I do no more ...? {06}{07}
Send my apologies to the
Princess. I can no
longer aid our alliance.  
I, I must withdraw ...{end}

Hee hee! Time for lift off!
Let's go, go, go!{end}

Yes, ma'am!
Your wish is my command,
my Princess!{end}

Don't let the Empire
near Langrisser!{end}

In Lady Jessica's stead,
I will take Langrisser!{end}

Cherie will not get Langrisser.
Stop her by any
means necessary!{end}

I may be a bit behind,
but I'll catch up fast!{end}

I've no desire to let
the Empire further its aims.{06}{07}
{02}, prepare yourself!{end}

I will pursue my
dream to the end.{06}{07}
Because of my determination,
I can triumph over any
opponent, even you, Cherie.{end}

Think you can
dodge my sword?{end}

Aaahhh--!
I'm still hurt
from fighting earlier ...{end}

Cherie, know when you're
at your limits. I'll take care
of everything from here on.{end}

Thanks, Lady Jessica ...{end}

{02}, your strength is
truly incredible ...
To have defeated everyone ...{06}{07}
You won't be so
lucky next time.{06}{07}
As soon as our army
has recovered, we'll crush
your ambitions!{end}

Lady Jessica's not alone
as long as I'm still around ...{end}

Princess!
Please, stop gambling with
the devil and retreat!{06}{07}
We shall annihilate
those Imperials and
protect Langrisser!{06}{07}
Don't worry about us.
We can handle it!{end}

Forgive me ...
Please, do as you've said ...{end}

Lady Jessica's not alone
as long as I'm around ... {06}{07}
But I'm done fighting for now.
Everyone, I beg of you, ...
wipe out those Imperials.{end}

Taste our power!{end}

H, how regrettable ...{end}

I won't lose to
any Imperial Army!{end}

Wh, what strength ...{end}

Our skill with magic
should not be taken lightly ...{end}

I only made
it this far ...{end}

The sword shall
not be taken!{06}{07}
Whoever passes here
seals his own death!{end}

Gaahh--!{end}

Its too early
for this ...{end}

Feel the power of the
Kalxath Aerial Knights!{end}

D, damn you!{end}

Damn you,
Imperial scum bags!{end}

You all cannot ...
have ... Langrisser ...{end}

Grrr ...
Lady Jessica and the Princess
have both been defeated ... {06}{07}
For those mistakes,
{02} and Leon, I've no
choice but to kill you.{end}

At least they spared us
the sentimental twaddle.
Well, on to the next bunch.{end}

Bastard! You're
really crossing the line!{end}

You Imperials are impressive,
making it through to us.{end}

Please stop, Cherie!{06}{07}
You're only hurting yourself
by fighting with that wound.
You should retreat for now.{end}

We've brushed aside our foes.
There won't be
any further hindrance.{end}

Now, we can approach
the altar uninterrupted.{end}

So this ...
So this is Langrisser!{end}

Aye. From here on,
the Empire has our
hearts and blades.{end}

Indeed.
For a peaceful world,
we offer our best.{end}

That's right!{end}

If only Eliza and
my daughter developed
boobs like yours!{06}{07}
Gah ha ha!
Stop acting like pansies
and get a move on!{end}

If you think about it,
we have the long-term
advantage ...{end}

Even so, we'd
better take our next
steps quickly.{06}{07}
Bring on the next fight!{end}

Vargas re-joins the entourage!{end}

All right, back to
the Imperial Capital!{end}

All right, time to 
head back to headquarters!{end}

I can still do it!{06}{07}
Just because Langrisser
has been taken doesn't mean
I'll be defeated!{end}

Gah hah hah!
I've come to save the day!{end}

General Vargas!{end}

Hmmm ...
You're in a good
mood, Vargas.{06}{07}
Is it really okay to leave
your wife alone for this?{end}

Is it all right to leave
Miss Eliza unattended?{end}

Sure! Gah hah!
She's already given birth.
It was a girl.{06}{07}
My cute daughter is
round as a ball, just like me!
Gah hah hah!{end}

Geh heh heh.
It went as expected ...{end}

I, I see.
Th, that's wonderful ...{end}

Good point.{06}{07}
It's a pity you've all
been outmoded. You see, for
a grand, unified continent,
the Empire's unnecessary.{06}{07}
This sword and myself
will be sufficient.{06}{07}
What need is there
for the Kaiser ... when I
can reign over El Sallia?{end}

Stop playing around.
{02}!? Hurry up and
hand over the sword!{end}

Yes, what unlimited power ...
My reign over this continent
would be quite assured.{end}

No ...
You'd betray the Empire?
{02}!{end}

Betray?{06}{07}
You're not thinking clearly.
Someone must bring order
to this continent. Why not me?{06}{07}
I have Langrisser.{06}{07}
Bringing order ...
Ending strife ...
I can do it all.{end}

{02}!
Stop talking nonsense!{06}{07}
Then you'd be in direct
competition with our Kaiser!{end}

It, unfortunately,
may come to that.{end}

You bastard.
You think you can just
back-stab us all?{end}

Well, how about it?
Won't you join me?{06}{07}
Without the Empire weighing
us down, we can
truly work for peace.{end}

No way.{06}{07}
You've stolen that dream
from His Majesty, the Kaiser.{06}{07}
It's his vision, and only
he can realise it!{end}

Hein, will you
come with me?{end}

S, sure ...{end}

This sounds interesting.
I'll lend my sword, too.{end}

Then it's decided ...{06}{07}
We are now at odds
with the Imperial Army.{06}{07}
I can bring peace far more
quickly than any Empire.{end}

You damned kid ...!
You'll pay for this in blood!{end}

We also refuse to
collaborate with you!{end}

Soon, a new world
will be born.{06}{07}
And those who stand with
us shall become its Lords!{end}

With Langrisser in
the Kaiser's hands, no enemy
will stand against him.{06}{07}
The Legendary Sword
is said to grant its wielder
infinite power ... {06}{07}
Can I really give
up such an opportunity?{end}

Do you give the
sword to the Empire?{end}

Good point.{06}{07}
It's fortunate that my
goals align so closely with
those of the Empire.{06}{07}
I will take Langrisser for the
Kaiser, and together
we will bring peace and order!{end}

Damn!
We are too late!{end}

How can this be?
I was only a
few steps short ...{end}

Obtained Langrisser.{end}

Our dream is coming
closer and closer
to its realisation.{06}{07}
Warfare will soon
trouble this
world no longer ...{end}

...?{06}{07}
What's with this sword?
It's a piece of junk!{06}{07}
Well, there is no point in
just leaving it here ...
I may as well take it along.{end}

Obtained the Masayan Sword.{end}

You've done well,
{02}!{06}{07}
With Langrisser in hand,
all the continent will
soon know Imperial order.{end}

{02}, you're the
most scheming piece of shit
I've ever come across.{06}{07}
You're not worthy of
the Empire's boot heels.{06}{07}
You killed Zorum,
and now this ...{06}{07}
When you die, it shall
be with my knife in
your throat. Wait for it, boy.{end}
