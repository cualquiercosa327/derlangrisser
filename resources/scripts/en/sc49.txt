Father, I have
come as you requested.{end}

Ah, good.
We have just received some
troubling news.{06}{07}
It seems that {02} has
left Lady Cherie's side.
He is working with the Empire.{end}

You cannot be serious!{end}

That is not all.
He has taken Langrisser.{end}

For the Imperials?{end}

I see ...{06}{07}
Things have become
quite grim, have they not?{end}

They have ...{end}

As things stand,
Cherie and her group
are in great danger.{06}{07}
We must send our
army for Kalxath.
I shall lead the way!{end}

Well said.
Your spirit brings me
pride, my son.{end}

You speak too highly
of me, Father.
It's embarrassing ...{end}

Anyway, I will leave now
and marshal our forces.{end}

Has it been ten years
since he came to this
house as an orphan ...?{06}{07}
He has grown to be
a splendid young man.{end}

Lord Loren, we've got trouble!
The Imperial Army has
laid siege to the mansion!{end}

Wh, what!?
Since when?{end}

Their preparations were hasty.
We may have the advantage.{end}

If this drags on, word
will get to Kalxath.{06}{07}
We need to make
excellent use of our time.{end}

The crushing of Salrath
needs to be executed
with stealthy precision.{06}{07}
Heh heh ...
It sounds like a job for
my elite troops.{end}

I see now ...{06}{07}
By rapidly taking territory,
we can reduce their morale
and prevent alliances.{end}

And without allies, each
country will soon
extend its hand to the Empire.{end}

Use magic to cut
them off. Don't let a single
soldier escape.{end}

Just like Egbert said,
they're probably going
to turn tail and run.{06}{07}
Encircle and isolate.
Fight close, and crush them
for the unity of El Sallia!{end}

We're completely
surrounded ...{06}{07}
If worse comes to worst,
we'll face the Empire's
Four Heavenly Dragons.{06}{07}
We'll need more
than military might
against them ...{end}

Father!{end}

Scott, escape at
the first opportunity and 
go to Castle Kalxath.{06}{07}
Tell them of the
Imperial invasion!{end}

Father, if I do that ...{end}

Don't worry.
My mansion won't fall
to men like these!{06}{07}
Focus on your mission, Scott.
And remember
your lessons well.{end}

Our victory here must
be absolute. Make certain
no one escapes!{06}{07}
If anybody leaves here
alive, the operation will fail.
Crush as many as possible
while they're inside!{end}

Scott, don't
miss your chance!
Go now!{end}

I won't!{end}

Those bastards.
Aren't they going
to surrender?{end}

Why won't you cooperate?
We are working
to create true peace!{end}

By resisting us like this,
you're only prolonging the
bloodshed! Aren't you weary?{06}{07}
Why won't you
face facts?{end}

If he escapes, he'll
bring reinforcements!{end}

No one must learn
of our invasion.{06}{07}
We can't let a
single enemy escape.{end}

{02}, I
place myself under
your command.{06}{07}
There's no time to waste.
I need instructions quickly.{end}

My thanks.
I'll take charge
at once.{end}

Imperial soldiers, my men
fight vigorously when cornered.
You'll learn this the hard way.{end}

Scott ...
Please, don't waste
your life here ...{06}{07}
Rally our friends in Kalxath
and abroad. If we combine
our efforts, we can
surely take on the Empire.{end}

Father, take care!{end}

I leave it to you!{06}{07}
Bring our friends together,
and we will crush the
Empire once and for all!{end}

I will do this.{end}

Father ...
I swear I will make it all the
way to Castle Kalxath ...{end}

Lord Loren, join me in
my oath. We will
arrive there together.{end}

Lord Scott, I swear by
my sword that I shall live ...
to see Kalxath's gates.{end}

Without fail, we will see
our friends in Kalxath!{06}{07}
And from there, we'll
work to overthrow your
despicable Empire!{end}

You examine the walls to
find an engraved inscription.{06}{07}

"If you desire power,
offer me a prayer."{06}{07}

What will you pray for?{end}

More troops{end}

Attack power{end}

Defence power{end}

Maximum Troops raised!{end}

AT raised by 1 point.{end}

DF raised by 1 point.{end}

Sir {02},
why have you joined
the Empire ...?{end}

Forgive me, Scott.
I've put a lot of thought
into my decision.{06}{07}
I've concluded that
the Empire, through unifying
this continent, offers the
surest way to peace.{06}{07}
And I don't hesitate
to kill anyone
who gets in our way!{end}

I'm not the wide-eyed youth
you remember, {02}.{06}{07}
And I see that solution
for what it is--
short-sighted and foolish.{end}

Still, why do you sacrifice
your men? Surely you see
its uselessness at this point.{end}

If we don't give it our all,
then our dreams
will fade into nothing.{06}{07}
To achieve things, you have
to take risks. In this case,
I risk my life for my dream.{end}

It can't be!
An enemy of
this calibre ...{end}

Gaahhh--!
The Salrath soldiers
are truly top-notch!{end}

I've no wish to cut down
those who cooperate.{06}{07}
But I similarly have
no qualms striking
down those who won't!{end}

Shit!
I'm hurt really bad ...!{end}

I've demonstrated my
other talents, but now
it's time to fight!{end}

Hmph!
Such carelessness ...{end}

Ah, damn!
You did that to me!?{end}

Hey, clumsy.
I'm over here!{end}

H, how foolish of me!{end}

Oh, this is intriguing.
So you'd raise a sword
against me, eh?{end}

Just a little more effort ...{06}{07}
Just a little longer,
before His Majesty's
world comes to life ...{end}

We have to
face the facts.{06}{07}
Continuing under
these conditions
is impossible.{end}

Forgive me, Scott.
For once, I couldn't stave
off our invaders.{06}{07}
Let us watch over Salrath
from the heavens ... my son.{end}

Get out of here, Scott!{end}

You won't be running
amok much longer!{end}

Most impressive work,
Imperial soldiers.
But I can't die here!{end}

Ooohhh--! Damnation!
Even if you break through,
Scott will ... Scott ... will ...!{end}

I can't die!{06}{07}
Until Scott is avenged,
I definitely can't die!{end}

Uuggghh--!
Is this the best I could do!?
Scott, forgive me ...{06}{07}
Whatever happens,
don't follow the fate
of your Father ...{end}

Father!
Please, hang on!{end}

...{06}{07}
Scott, continue to learn.
Always improve your tactics, 
and travel the Knight's path.{06}{07}
I have no regrets. Save that ...
you'd had the chance to be an
ordinary child, for a time ...{end}

Father ... 
What are you talking about?{06}{07}
Even though I was
an orphan, you raised
me as a true son.{06}{07}
You're the best Father I 
could have wished for!{end}

Thank you, Scott. 
You've indulged an old man's
ego till the very end ...{06}{07}
Swear to tell ... 
Kalxath ... The rest, the rest ... 
I leave to you ... my son ...{end}

Father!{06}{07}
I swear I'll get to Kalxath.
Please, watch over me.{end}

Salrath won't be able 
to hold out much longer ...{06}{07}
Sir {02} ...
You silence all opposition
through your thuggery.{06}{07}
If this is what you call
peace, you're sorely mistaken.
Soon, you'll earn the hatred
of all mankind!{end}

These times are hard, but how
many people need to die
before they simply understand?{06}{07}
If the Empire reigns, there
will be no opposition.
No opposition means no war ...{06}{07}
Dissent is a weed, and
I will tear it out
by its rebellious roots.{06}{07}
After this, people
will have the opportunity
to trust one another.{06}{07}
The Empire knows peace
must come first,
through unification ...{06}{07}
Kalxath wants understanding
before peace, but
they have it backwards.{end}

A man hates war, but
he attacks his neighbours and
starts conflict after conflict.{06}{07}
Do you see a
small contradiction
in his logic?{end}

Scott!
Hurry, now!{end}

But ...{end}

It doesn't matter
what happens to me!{06}{07}
You must take
word to Kalxath!{end}

Understood ...
Take care, Father.{end}

I leave it to you ...{end}

Father ...
I swear to survive this
and go to Kalxath.{end}

I won't be defeated
in this place!{end}

Don't lose!{06}{07}
For Father's sake,
we absolutely
can't be defeated!{end}

Out of my way!
There's no way
my Father will fall!{end}

Gaahh--!{end}

Scott!{end}

Forgive me ...
Father ...{06}{07}
I trained hard, ...
but it wasn't enough ...{end}

Hang in
there, Scott!{end}

For raising and caring
for an orphan to this day ...
I humbly offer my thanks.{06}{07}
After all you've done, ...
I've repaid you with
my wasteful death ...{06}{07}
For my Father's best efforts ...
For this world ...
I die ... Forgive me.{end}

Scccotttt!{06}{07}
I've never thought
you any less
than my own child.{06}{07}
Even if we've different blood,
you will always be my son.{06}{07}
That's ...
That's why ... {06}{07}
Damn you, Imperials!
You'll know a father's
vengeance for his child!{end}

Ugh--
I can't do this
any longer ...{06}{07}
Sir {02} ...
You silence all opposition
through your thuggery.{06}{07}
If this is what you call
peace, you're sorely mistaken.
Soon, you'll earn the hatred
of all mankind!{end}

These times are hard, but how
many people need to die
before they simply cooperate?{06}{07}
If the Empire reigns, there
will be no opposition.
No opposition means no war ...{06}{07}
Dissent is a weed, and
I will tear it out by
its rebellious roots.{06}{07}
After this, people
will have the opportunity
to trust one another.{06}{07}
The Empire knows peace
must come first,
through unification ...{06}{07}
Kalxath wants understanding
before peace, but
they have it backwards.{end}

I see ...{06}{07}
Father, forgive me ...
I didn't keep
your promise ...{end}

We'll teach you to make
light of the Salrath Army!{end}

Impossible ...{end}

I don't want to die yet.
I don't want to ... die ...{end}

No!
Don't come here!{end}

Aaahh!{end}

Move to Kalxath
with all haste!{06}{07}
We'll complete our mission,
even if only one of us survives!{end}

Let's hurry to Kalxath!{end}

For Lord Loren and Lord Scott,
I swear to reach Kalxath!{end}

Damn you, Imperials,
for bringing
us to such straits!{end}

Looks like ... I'll join
all our old friends ...{end}

I'll stop the Empire from
its relentless crimes!
I'll definitely escape!{end}

Die!{end}

A welcoming committee, eh ...{end}

For a father's pride,
please look after Scott.{end}

Yes, Sir!
Leave it to me!{end}

Lord Scott,
I shall see to your defence!{end}

Lord Scott,
Forgive me for failing
in your protection ...{06}{07}
Ugghh!{end}

Everyone, forgive me.{06}{07}
If I'd been a bit stronger,
many would still be alive ...{06}{07}
But, by whatever means,
I'll make it to Kalxath!{end}

Ugh!{end}

Misha ...,
I apologize ...
I can't go on ...{end}

Gaaahh!{end}

We must retreat
by whatever means,
against all instinct ...{06}{07}
We'll sweep our
homeland of Imperial
scum some other day!{end}

Out of my way, pest!
I'm going to Kalxath!{end}

S, such strength.
Too much ...{end}

Whatever it takes,
I will arrive in Kalxath.
Let's go!{end}

Go back to the Empire!
This place isn't for you!{end}

Im, impossible!
That I could die ...{end}

I can't afford to
lose to you ruffians.{end}

You can't overcome
our burning
desire for victory!{end}

The fight is over ...{end}

This fighting you
speak of is terrible, indeed.
I'm quite troubled.{06}{07}
After all, 
Scott and Lord Loren
are not wicked men ...{end}

This victory for the Empire
is a necessary step on
the path to world peace.{06}{07}
What do you think will
happen if we allow
them to reach Kalxath?{end}

If soldiers leave these
grounds, we'll have trouble.{06}{07}
We must defeat all
our opponents here.{end}

You're right.{06}{07}
If we allow them to drum up
support, our assault on Kalxath
will be very bothersome.{06}{07}
No one will leave here.{end}

Anyone we leave behind could
call sympathizers to Salrath.{06}{07}
If that happened, things would
get quite out of hand. They'd
certainly reinforce Kalxath.{06}{07}
That's why, beforehand,
we need to crush them.{06}{07}
Before we hit Kalxath, we'll
make sure they fight alone!{end}

I'll remember this,
Imperial soldiers!
I promise to repay this villainy!{end}

Shit!
They got away!{end}

Now we've got
a clear path ...{end}

We need a bit more prudence
in picking our fights ...{end}

It's regrettable, but I can't
resort to my sword.
I've no choice but to escape.{06}{07}
So, everyone, let's
hurry to Kalxath!{06}{07}
We can spread word about
the Imperial invasion!{end}

It's regrettable, but
I can't resort to my sword.
All units, retreat!{06}{07}
It doesn't matter who, but
someone must take word
to our friends at Kalxath!{end}

Lord Loren!
Are you all right!?{end}

Ah, you're
Lord Aaron's soldiers!{end}

Yes, Sir.{06}{07}
We saw some suspicious
activity, so we came to
see what was going on.{end}

Your timing couldn't
be more perfect.{06}{07}
All units, retreat to Kalxath!
Run, all of you!{end}

Are you sure about that?{end}

I'm fine.
But my son ...{end}

Oh no ... I see now ...{06}{07}
Lord Aaron told us
to investigate some
suspicious movement,
but we had no idea ...{end}

Ah, I see, but it no
longer matters.
We can't hold out here.{06}{07}
As much as I hate to say it ...
you'd be best served by
withdrawing to Kalxath.{06}{07}
Join your friends and
bring justice to the Empire!{end}

Got it!{end}

It doesn't matter who!{06}{07}
Go to Kalxath and tell
them of the Empire's attack!{end}

It doesn't matter who!{06}{07}
Escape to Kalxath and take
word of the Imperial invasion!
All units, retreat to Kalxath!{end}

Forgive me, I didn't
quite make it outside ...{06}{07}
Lord Loren ...
was murdered by Imperials!{end}

I see. Please, relax ...{06}{07}
Through the great
efforts of Lord Aaron, we've
come to aid Salrath.{end}

It's no use.
Even if we go,
we'll be too late ...{end}

There's still time!
Bring word of the Imperial
invasion to Kalxath!{06}{07}
If you do that, Kalxath can
assemble an army to
challenge the Empire!{end}

All right, understood.
Everyone, let's
escape to Kalxath!{end}

What!?
Reinforcements have arrived?{06}{07}
Well, no reason to get
worked up. Just some
more grist for the mill ...{end}

But, there are those here
who will inform
Kalxath of our advance.{06}{07}
We can't just leave
them to their mission.{end}

We have to scrub this place.
No trace of our
involvement should remain.{end}

I see.
So if we leave them alive,
we'll regret it later.{end}

We have to scrub this place.
No trace of our
involvement should remain.{06}{07}
If we leave anyone alive,
we'll regret it later.{end}

Understood!{end}
