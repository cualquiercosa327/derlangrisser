Your Majesty, what shall
we do about the traitor?{end}

He is of little concern.{06}{07}
The boy has enough enemies.
His end will come soon enough.{end}

Shouldn't His Majesty
rest for a little while?{end}

Hah!
Wounds like these won't
fell your Kaiser.{06}{07}
Our troops have momentum.
Let them keep it.{end}

But, Your Majesty ...{end}

What!? We're being followed?
It, it's {02}!{end}

Damn! They move quickly ...{end}

You won't escape so easily,
Kaiser of Rayguard.{end}

Ah, it's the annoying little brat!
I see you're eager to die.{end}

I'll remain and hold them.
The rest of you, honour
your duty to His Majesty.{end}

Leon, please see to
His Majesty's care.{end}

...{06}{07}
Very well.{end}

Looks like we're facing the
Flaming Fag Brigade, or
whatever they call themselves.{end}

If we take too much time,
we'll lose the main force.{end}

All right, let's strike quickly.
Our target is General Vargas!{end}

Come on then,
red-haired brat!{06}{07}
I'll show you the power of the
Imperial Blazing Dragon Army's
most elite forces!{end}

It's not over yet!
We can still stop them.{end}

Just a bit longer ...
If we can buy ourselves
a little more time, then ...{end}

Watch out, {02}.
At this rate, we're going
to lose the Kaiser!{end}

{02}!
You're taking far too long!
Are you letting him go!?{end}

Don't you see, {02}!?
If you take too much time,
you'll lose sight of the Kaiser!{end}

This is getting critical ...
Don't waste your time on trash!
Focus on their commanders!{end}

Gwah hah hah!
His Majesty is over the horizon!
You'll never find him now.{06}{07}
Mission complete!
Time to withdraw.{end}

Grrr ...
We took too long ...{end}

They've crossed the bridge!
Your Majesty, please hurry!{end}

Of course.{end}

Brat!
If you come any further,
don't think you'll live.{end}

Some dirty mice are playing
with a small stone.{06}{07}

Will you drive them away?{end}

The dirty mice run away,
leaving the small stone.{06}{07}

As you pick up the stone,
it begins to shine ...{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

The dirty mice continue to play
with the stone and take it away.{end}

Out of the way!
We have no time for
this nonsense!{end}

M, my heart just
wasn't in it ...{end}

Why ...?{end}

Damn kids!{end}

And we came all
this way, too ...{end}

{font3}Uugghh, I've been ...
{font3}defeated ...!{end}

{font3}Arrrrghh--!
{font3}This host ... too weak ...{end}

You're an honourable man.
If it can be helped,
I don't want to kill you.{06}{07}
Leon, the future is with us.
Won't you join our cause?{end}

...{06}{07}
You speak of something
that can never be.{06}{07}
A knight swears fealty to
his Kaiser, and that
oath I will never break.{06}{07}
You will always be
at the tip of my sword,
{02} the traitor.{end}

I guess there's no other way.
But this is also Lord B{3a}ser's
wish ... Have at you, Leon!{end}

Forgive me, L{37}na.
I must defend His Majesty!{end}

Ooh, I was a bit clumsy ...
Take care of the rest, please.{end}

W, well done ...!
I'm sorry, {02}.
I have to retreat!{end}

Take care of
the rest here, Vargas.{end}

Understood.{end}

Forgive me ...
Take care of the rest.{end}

Worry not!
Once these rats have been
scattered, I'll soon follow.{end}

I'll be waiting for you.{end}

Ugh! My wound is ...,
No, not again ...{end}

Someone, escort
His Majesty to safety!{end}

Your Majesty, this way.{end}

Leon, take
care of his Majesty.{end}

You have my word.
I shall protect him!{end}

You've kept up with us
for a while now.
That's pretty good.{06}{07}
But you'll soon be
left in the dust.{end}

You shall not pass!{end}

Curses ...
Vargas, it's up to you!{end}

You'd better leave it
to me and head out.{end}

General Vargas, we shall
be praying for your victory!{end}

Thank you.
Now, please look after
the Kaiser.{end}

Ugh, damn it!{end}

Colonel Laird, over here ...{end}

You'd better look out, brat!
This time, I'm paying
you back for Zorum's death!{end}

You'd better look out, brat!
This time, I'm really
going to kick your ass!{end}

Aaaaarrrghhhhh--!{end}

Punk, prepare yourself!{end}

Ugh, im, impossible ...
I, I am General Vargas ... of
the Blazing Dragon Army.{06}{07}
Uugghhh ...
Please look after ...
Eliza and ... Emilia ...{end}

Vargas, you fought splendidly.
Your death shall not be wasted,
I promise you, old friend.{end}

Farewell, General Vargas ...{end}

This is the end of the
Blazing Dragon Army, isn't it?{end}

The mighty Vargas ...
He was a great soldier
to his last breath.{end}

I couldn't have said
it better myself. Instead of
running, he faced death.{end}

We can't compromise the
defence of Castle Velzeria!
Everyone, let's get moving!{end}

Vargas, don't get lost out here.
Join up with us soon.{end}

I know, I know.
Don't worry about me and
just get moving.{end}

Insolent punks!
It's payback time!{end}

How dare you!
Your punishment will come!{end}

Don't die ...{end}

You, you have
to protect the Empire!{end}

Heh, you don't
have to go that far.{end}

D, damn these wounds ...
How can I succumb to them?{06}{07}
Next time we
meet shall be your last!{end}

Maintain forward mobility
and engage the enemy!{end}

Please!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

If you want to get through,
you'll have to fell me.{end}

And you did ...{end}

Even if you cut me to ribbons,
I can't allow you to proceed!{end}

I can't let
you near the Kaiser!{end}

You'll have a very
painful demise ...{end}

Ugh, no good ...{end}

Take that!
There will be no prisoners!{end}

Long live the Kaiser!
Long live the Empire!{end}

So you came here of
your own accord.
You certainly are spirited.{end}

Well done ...{end}

My sword ...
I thought my attack
was unstoppable ...{end}

So, I'm the last one left.
I'm not giving in.
Don't even think it.{06}{07}
I'll provide His Majesty
and his troops whatever time
and distance they need.{06}{07}
Now then, red-haired punk.
Stop your gawking
and let us cross blades!{end}

So you've chased us this far ...
You have endurance, all right.{end}

We need to concentrate
on giving chase, lest they
move out of our sight!{end}

They are likely headed
to Castle Velzeria ...{end}
