Will we find B{3a}ser inside?{end}

Yes. This is Velzeria,
the forbidden land.{06}{07}
According to legend,
light confronted and sealed
the darkness here.{06}{07}
Our enemy stands
behind these walls.{end}

We've finally
come this far ...{end}

Yes, we have.
Perhaps I will fulfil
my vow to Lester--{end}

So, you stumbled
your way here.{end}

Damn it!
They're everywhere ...!{end}

When did you ...!?{end}

You won't
take another step!{end}

Sonya!{end}

Rohga ...{end}

{02}, please give me
one last chance.
I'll persuade her this time.{06}{07}
Let me speak
with Sonya.{end}

All right.
Everyone, back up Rohga
until he reaches her.{end}

Leave it to me, Rohga.
I'll defend you.{end}

Everyone, charge!{end}

Lord B{3a}ser's ceremony must
go uninterrupted! For the dawn
of our new era, fend them off!{end}

{font3}For the age
of darkness!{end}

{font3}For Lord B{3a}ser!{end}

...{end}

Sonya ...
Why do you continue
to resent humans?{06}{07}
You're allowing the
same tragedies to
repeat themselves.{end}

...{end}

Stop tormenting me!
B{3a}ser is so much
nicer than my brother!{end}

Don't you remember
how it was, Sonya?
Can't we be family again?{end}

Is this it ...{end}

I'm sorry everyone,
but I can't stand this ...{end}

If you follow the darkness,
we will end you along with it!{end}

You humans will
never change. You only
think of yourselves!{06}{07}
I'll always hate you,
even my brother!{end}

No ...
S, Sonya ... Please!{end}

Rohga, don't be careless!
You're losing blood.{end}

But if we retreat now ...{end}

Brother, forget it ...
I can't go back ...{06}{07}
I've stained my hands
too much to go back to
my brother's side ...{end}

How could ...{end}

Master Rohga!{end}

I'm okay.
I just lost concentration.{06}{07}
I need time to recover.{end}

Yes ...{end}

I was unprepared ...
Forgive me, {02}.
It's up to you now!{end}

{font3}Ugghh!
How dare you!{06}{07}
{font3}Bastard, I'll return
the favour one day!{end}

God, how stupid I was!
Grrr--! I'll remember this!{end}

How could I be
beaten by monsters ...{end}

I don't want to see
my brother's face any more!
Get out of here!{end}

Brother, please!
Don't make me suffer.{end}

Damn!{end}

Ugh ...
So those are my brother's
trusted companions ...{end}

Sonya!
Get a hold of yourself, Sonya!{end}

Sorry, brother ...
I'm finished ...{06}{07}
But I don't feel lonely ..., 
because I get
to lay in your arms ...{end}

Ahh ... always ...
together, like old times ...{06}{07}
...{end}

S, Sonya!{06}{07}
Nooooooooooo!{end}

...{end}

You bastards ...
If Sonya wasn't perverted
by you scum ...!{06}{07}
B{3a}ser, when we meet,
I'll make you beg for Hell!{end}

Hold on, Sonya!{end}

Why ...?
I'm your enemy.{end}

No, you're my
kid sister.{06}{07}
Just this once, 
please remember that! {end}

Aahh, so warm.
I'll never forget the kindness
you've shown me.{06}{07}
If I'd never met B{3a}ser ...
No, now it's too late.{end}

Tell my brother ...
Sonya left behind her hatred
and accepted humans, and ...{06}{07}
I'm grateful he came
all the way here to find me.{end}

Sonya, hang on, Sonya!{end}

If only she saw things
as they really were.
Without confusion ...{06}{07}
B{3a}ser, your end is coming.
I will defeat you!{end}

...{end}

How emotional.{06}{07}
I didn't know she
had so little conviction.{end}

Please, don't say that.{06}{07}
She didn't lay anything on
her parents' deaths ...
She accepted responsibility.{end}

When is this going to end?
I'll go on ahead.{end}

Wait up!
I'm going too!{end}

...{end}

You're a strong man.
Use this sadness and
remember what we fight for.{06}{07}
I'll wait for you ahead.{end}

Th, that ...{end}

...{06}{07}
Against B{3a}ser, I'm at
your side, Rohga.{end}

I couldn't save you ...{06}{07}
Ever since you left,
I've thought about it.
And in the end ...{06}{07}
I failed you and I failed us.
I, I've lost my purpose.{06}{07}
But ...{06}{07}
God damn it!
There's war to fight, and
I have to keep going!{end}

On the frozen
fields of Kadath!{end}

Or on the charred
rock of Seviglia!{end}

No matter what adversity
I face, I'll survive it all!{end}

Everything I've done
was for your happiness.{end}

Farewell ...
We'll meet again,
Sonya ...{end}

{font3}Ahh, the amazing
Langrisser. Powerful ...{end}

{font3}When B{3a}ser's
recovered, ... you will ...{end}

{font3}Gaaahhh--!{end}

{font3}Ooohh--!{end}

{font3}Ugh!{end}

{font3}Uugghhh--!{end}

{font3}Argh ...{end}

{font3}Ugh ...{end}

{font3}You humans would dare
defy us monsters!?{06}{07}
{font3}You'll pay for that
foolish notion
with your lives!{end}

{font3}You damn humans ...{end}

{font3}Mmmmm, delicious
looking humans.{06}{07}
{font3}Come sleep
in my arms.{end}

{font3}Gaahhh!
H, how dare ...{end}

{font3}How could this ...!?
How can I, the Prince
of the Undead, die ...{end}

{font3}Sonya's been killed!
Run, withdraw quickly!{end}

{font3}Sonya betrayed us.
Go tell B{3a}ser.{end}

Rohga ...
We should give up on Sonya.{06}{07}
Nothing you've said
has made a difference.{06}{07}
Persuading her
is impossible.{end}

You may be right ...{06}{07}
But I'll try if there's
the slightest
chance she'll turn around.{06}{07}
When my last effort fails ...
I will ... finish things.{end}

I see.
Well, we will help
however we can.{end}

Thanks ...
I'm in your debt.{end}

Sonya!
I don't want to lose you!
Please, listen to me!{end}

What are you talking about!?
You are my enemy!{end}

Sonya!{end}

...{end}

Listen up, Sonya!{06}{07}
You've been thinking
only of those
horrible memories.{06}{07}
If that were all of human
nature, I'd understand you.
I might even agree!{06}{07}
But have you forgotten our
guardian, Ikreuz? Don't you
remember how he raised us?{end}

Father v ...{end}

Yes, remember
Ikreuz's kindness.{06}{07}
That warm feeling
of having Ikreuz care
for us like a father!{end}

...{06}{07}
In that chilly forest,
we were freezing.{06}{07}
A soft, welcoming hand
reached out to us.
It felt like father was there.{end}

If Ikreuz never found us,
I'd probably detest
humans as much as you do.{06}{07}
Humans are weak.
They hurt each other and
don't know or care.{06}{07}
But despite their flaws,
they try hard, Sonya ...{end}

...{06}{07}
This era, this war,
stole our parents from us.
I see that now ...{end}

Yes, it has to end.{06}{07}
We must bring peace,
so that others
won't suffer as we did ...{06}{07}
Hate breeds bloodshed,
and bastards like B{3a}ser
take advantage of it!{06}{07}
Do you understand, Sonya?{end}

Brother ...{06}{07}
If this war ends,
can humans and demons
live in peace?{end}

Yes, they certainly can.
I've lived a long time
without trusting others.{06}{07}
But in {02} and Hein,
I've made some strong friends
and comrades.{06}{07}
With a trusting heart,
you can overcome
any misunderstanding.{end}

Sonya, please join us.
Together we can
build a better world.{end}

Yes, together, we'll bring
hope and prosperity
back to humans and demons.{end}

So kind ...
It's nice having friends.{06}{07}
I, I wonder if I
could get used to this ...{end}

Without a doubt!
We promise you!{end}

You'll learn to love it.
It's true!{end}

Thank you, everyone!{end}

I'm going to start over
and build a new life!{end}

Sonya joins the entourage!{end}

Hmph ...
B{3a}ser's the last detail.{end}

All right!
B{3a}ser's the only one left!{end}

B{3a}ser's inside this castle.{end}

Let's strike down
B{3a}ser at once!{end}

There's no point any more!
Listen to me, Sonya!{06}{07}
Why must we fight?{end}

Because you're a human,
and I'm half-demon!{end}

When are you going to
stop sulking about that!?{06}{07}
Stop dwelling on
things and just listen
to me, Sonya!{end}

You're always like that ...{06}{07}
You think you know me,
but you don't understand.{06}{07}
I hate you!
I really hate you!{06}{07}
If you were worried
about me, why didn't you
come back sooner!{06}{07}
My hands are so bloody ...,
there's no way I could go back.{end}

...{end}

No, the only thing
I know is fighting.{06}{07}
Even if I'm defeated,
I chose this life and
I accept everything ...!{end}

Fuck! Why ...?{06}{07}
Why did it have
to come to this?{end}

Brother, take up
your sword!{06}{07}
You'll fight me, or
I'll kill you.
It's your choice!{end}

Why, Sonya?
What did I ever
do wrong?{end}

A red medicine bottle
is hanging from the wall.{06}{07}

Will you drink it?{end}

AT raised by 1 point!{06}{07}

The sound of a smashing
bottle elsewhere is heard.{end}

A blue medicine bottle
is hanging from the wall.{06}{07}

Will you drink it?{end}

MP raised by 2 points!{06}{07}

You hear a sound of another
bottle breaking somewhere.{end}
