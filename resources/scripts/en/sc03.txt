{font4}{skip 71}P{font0}rologue{06}{07}
In its long history, the continent
El Sallia has been a dark
land marked by endless battle.{06}{07}
{02}, a young swordsman,
has been travelling its countryside
with his friend, Hein, an apprentice
magician he met on his journeys.{06}{07}
Their long travels have led
them to the outskirts of Hein's
home town, where the travellers
decided to seek rest at the inn.{06}{07}
Village life was quiet and peaceful.
Amidst a sea of smiling faces, the
weary travellers found respite
from the wars ravaging El Sallia.{06}{07}
Days rolled into nights and passed
on quite quickly, and
{02} began to enjoy
the quiet life of a villager.{06}{07}
Then one day, Hein suddenly
burst into the inn, his
face stricken pale as a ghost's.{06}{07}
The Imperial Knights of the
Rayguard Empire had disrupted the
village on imperial command,
seeking only a girl named Liana.{06}{07}
None knew why the knights, known
throughout the land for their
honour and righteousness, would
now attack such a peaceful village.{06}{07}
{02} and Hein left the
inn together to rescue Liana.{06}{07}

By a stroke of good fortune,
{02} rescued Liana from
her would-be kidnappers,
the Imperial Knights.{06}{07}
However, with Rayguard forces still
in pursuit, Loren, Lord of Salrath,
concluded it impossible to
defend her in his remote lands.{06}{07}
After a night of consideration,
they chose Estool, a shrine where
Liana once served as a novice,
as the safest hiding place.{06}{07}
When dawn broke, {02} and
Loren set out to escort Liana
along the road to Estool.{06}{07}
However, unwilling to relent in
their pursuit, an imperial
detachment led by Leon and Laird
awaited them at the crossroads ...{06}{07}

Having bested the Imperial Knights

journey to the shrine of Estool.{06}{07}
The shrine was renowned
across the land as a sanctuary
for passing pilgrims, guarded by
its force of warrior-priests.{06}{07}
After a night of bed rest,
dawn broke, and with it came
the head priest's acceptance
of Liana's custody.{06}{07}
With their journey drawing to
a close, the companions
pondered where to

Having sustained considerable

Shrine of Light could adequately
defend Liana no longer.{06}{07}
Cherie, a young lady from Kalxath,
extended to the companions the
protection of her country--one of
the few countries still resisting.{06}{07}
Accepting Cherie's invitation,
{02} and his companions
began their march to Kalxath.{06}{07}
They arrived in the
nick of time, for Castle Kalxath
had come under assault by
the Blazing Dragon Army.{06}{07}
Even with Kalxath's great strength,
the walls surely will not hold

The companions left Castle Kalxath
to seek the powerful sorceress,
Jessica, rumoured to know
the resting place of the Dark Rod.{06}{07}
According to legend, for several
hundred years she has lived in
seclusion, deep within the forests
beyond the flow of the Rall River.{06}{07}
As the companions
drew near the riverbank, they

However, as the companions drew

With the companions' failure,
Jessica left the entourage to seek
potential allies for Kalxath in the
coming war against Rayguard.{06}{07}
With the Dark Rod in hand, the
Empire was positioned to mount an
invasion force and conquer the
remaining El Sallian countryside.{06}{07}
Light's last hope is the power of a
legendary holy sword, able to
crush the powers of darkness, and
with them the Kaiser's ambitions.{06}{07}
Questing for the sword's barrow,
the companions came upon

Locked in a scramble against
time and foe to recover Langrisser,
{02} and his companions
fell prey to an imperial ambush.{06}{07}
An imperial regiment lay
across the suspension bridge--
the only path between the
cliffs of a deep chasm.{06}{07}
Kr{38}mer, under orders from Imelda,
the woman general of the Water
Dragon Navy, planned to sever the
ropes and collapse the bridge.{06}{07}
If the bridge collapses before
the companions can pass, it will
deal them an unrecoverable blow
in the race for Langrisser.{06}{07}

However, being forced to divide
