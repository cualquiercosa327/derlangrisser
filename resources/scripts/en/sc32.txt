I wonder how
everyone is doing ...?{end}

{02} ...{end}

What's going on!?
Who sounded the alarm?{end}

M, monsters!{end}

Arrggh!{end}

Damn it!{06}{07}

How did all these
monsters get in here!?{end}

You won't get any further!{06}{07}

Ugh ...!{06}{07}

Aarrrgghhh!{end}

{font3}Are you Liana?{end}

{font3}Where do you think
{font3}you're going?{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}You think you
{font3}can escape us?{end}

You needn't overexert
your pretty self.
We must to move quickly.{end}

No! Let go!{06}{07}
Help me, {02}!{end}

{font3}Lord B{3a}ser awaits ...{end}

Aaaaahhhh!{end}

Ha ha ha!
Well, that takes care of her.
I will go on ahead.{end}

{font3}Yesss ...
{font3}Yet another
{font3}successful mission.{end}

{font3}Let's head to the harbour
{font3}to stop her little
{font3}friends in their tracks! {end}

{font3}Let's hurry!{end}

{font3}You mean the ship
{font3}isn't yet readied ...?{end}

{font3}Yes ...
{font3}The cargo has been
{font3}difficult to load.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}I'm afraid that
{font3}our departure
{font3}has been delayed.{end}

{font3}We must move quickly!{end}

{font3}Right away,
{font3}your Lordship!{end}

Ahh, we made it at last.{06}{07}
I hope we can find a boat.{end}

Hmmm, look there!{end}

{font3}We have a problem!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}The Descendants of Light
{font3}are now moving in!{end}

{font3}What!?
{font3}Hasten the operation!{end}

{font3}Right away.{end}

That looks like one of
the Demon Tribe's boats.{06}{07}
What great timing.
Let's take it!{end}

Sounds like a plan
to me, Hein.{end}

All right, everyone!{06}{07}
Before they depart,
let's commandeer the ship!{end}

{font3}Esto and Osto
{font3}haven't returned yet,
{font3}have they?{end}

{font3}No, Esto and Osto
{font3}have special
{font3}orders from Lord B{3a}ser.{06}{07}
{font3}They search out the
{font3}way to revive Alhazard.{end}

{font3}Oh, really ...{end}

{font3}Listen up, everyone!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}There's no need to wait.
{font3}We can easily obliterate
{font3}the Descendants of Light
{font3}with our own power!{end}

{font3}Oooooh!
{font3}That sounds exciting.{end}

They seem to be seeking
another component
to unseal Alhazard.{06}{07}
Jessica said, "To revive
Alhazard, the Dark Rod and
a catalyst are needed."{end}

Are they are looking
for the catalyst to 
release Alhazard?{06}{07}
Oh, that's right, Jessica
said to revive Alhazard,
both the Dark Rod and a
catalyst are needed.{end}

Meaning that Alhazard
hasn't been released yet.{end}

That means Alhazard
hasn't been released yet.{end}

It would appear so.{06}{07}
However, if they're 
actively trying to unseal it,
then our time is limited.{06}{07}
We should
hurry to Velzeria.{end}

So ... let us go
to pick a fight!{06}{07}
If we don't take that
ship to Velzeria,
we might not make it.{end}

{font3}How are the departure
{font3}preparations going?{end}

{font3}Not quite finished ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Please wait 
{font3}a little longer.{end}

{font3}Hurry the hell up!{end}

{font3}You're still
{font3}not finished!?{end}

{font3}The loading will be
{font3}complete shortly.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Please have patience.{end}

{font3}Hey! The ship
{font3}still isn't ready!{end}

{font3}Sorry to keep
{font3}you waiting.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}The departure
{font3}preparations are
{font3}now complete.{end}

{font3}Sorry to keep
{font3}you waiting.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}We can go any time!{end}

{font3}All right!
{font3}Raise the anchor!
{font3}Let's get out of here.{end}

{font3}Are the ships
{font3}ready to depart?{end}

{font3}Preparations complete.{end}

{font3}Preparations complete.{end}

{font3}All right!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Let's head for Velzeria!{end}

Damn it!{06}{07}
We didn't make
it in time ...{end}

What should we do?{06}{07}
We can't go by foot
to Velzeria, it would
take too long ...{end}

Hmmm, now we
have a problem ...{06}{07}
We could go by foot to
Velzeria, but it would take
way too much time.{end}

We're in trouble now ...{06}{07}
It's not that we can't
go to Velzeria by foot, but
it would take forever.{end}

It won't help just
thinking about it.{06}{07}
We might as well start
down the road.
We'll probably find
another boat on the way.{end}

That's an idea ...
All right, let's go to
Velzeria by road!{end}

No point thinking
about it any further.{06}{07}
Let's get out of here.
To Velzeria we go!{end}

There is an old
wooden box lying here.{06}{07}

Will you open it?{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{end}

Damn, this is it--!{end}

Owww!{end}

Argh ...
I got trashed.{end}

Damn!{end}

Ohh, man!
I'm way out of
my league!{end}

Oh, my back ...{end}

Gaaahh--!{end}

{font3}We're not your
{font3}ordinary demons!{end}

{font3}Hya ha ha, ...
{font3}impressive!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Redheaded mortal, 
{font3}you'll remember this!{end}

{font3}For Lord B{3a}ser!{end}

{font3}Im, impossible ...{end}

{font3}You're just a
{font3}mere human!{end}

{font3}Hee hee hee ...
{font3}Ready or not,
{font3}here I come!{end}

{font3}Y, you ...
{font3}R, rotten humans!{end}

{font3}We will stain
{font3}the sea red!{end}

{font3}This cannot
{font3}be happening ...!{end}

{font3}H, how are mere
{font3}humans able to--?{end}

{font3}Ugghhh!{end}

{font3}Gahh--arghh!{end}

{font3}Ohhh!{end}

{font3}Ugghhh--!{end}

{font3}Oohhhh ...{end}

{font3}Aaaaahhh--!{end}

{font3}I suppose we may
{font3}have underestimated
{font3}your strength.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}How could a demon
{font3}be challenged by
{font3}a mere human? I
{font3}still don't believe it ...{end}

Ah, it's over now.{end}

We've taken the ship!{06}{07}
Well then, on
to Velzeria!{end}

Yeah, let's get going!{06}{07}
If these monsters were this
strong, imagine them after
Alhazard's revival.{end}

Well, let's head out!
To Velzeria!{end}

{font3}These mortals 
{font3}look skilled.{end}

{font3}Esto, Osto!{end}

{font3}A pity we were late.
{font3}But we have
{font3}taken the catalyst.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Egbert has surely
{font3}notified Lord B{3a}ser
{font3}of this development.{end}

{font3}And are we
{font3}ready to depart?{end}

{font3}I'm sorry.
{font3}We're not quite done.{end}

{font3}Hurry, then.{end}

{font3}Yes ...{end}

{font3}Ah, the mighty 
{font3}Descendants of Light.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Here you shall all die.
{font3}{font3}You won't get in
{font3}Lord B{3a}ser's way!{end}

Argh, such
powerful monsters!
We're up against it.{end}

Those are parasites!
They feed on human minds,
so be careful.{06}{07}
Don't forget your strategic
fundamentals and
you'll come out all right. {end}

{font3}Ahhh! How could
{font3}Esto and Osto
{font3}have been beaten ...{end}

{font3}You're still
{font3}not finished!?{end}
