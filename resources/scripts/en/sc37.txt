Both the Dark Rod and the
sealing maidens are here.{06}{07}
The preparations
are complete ... {06}{07}
Now let's commence with
Alhazard's revival!{end}

Hmmm, you certainly
haven't changed.{06}{07}
Just as focused
as ever, even after the
Kaiser's death ...{06}{07}
You really were using
him, weren't you?{end}

I would have used
anyone with great power.
Nothing more, nothing less.{end}

Hah, ...
what a callous
man you are.{06}{07}
Well, no more delays.
I shall begin the incantation.{06}{07}
{font4}I, Alhazard ...
I, Alhazard!{end}

Hold it right there!
You won't say
another verse!{end}

Heh heh. {06}{07}
I would expect
nothing less from
my wonderful teacher. {06}{07}
We were well hidden,
but even here,
you found us out.{end}

You of all people should
know the  danger
of using that sword!{06}{07}
Why are you
aiding the forces
of darkness!?{end}

My motives are
rather mysterious,
aren't they?{06}{07}
In this world, there
are those with power
and those without.{06}{07}
I want power.
That is all.{end}

This temple ...
What an eerie
place it is. {end}

Look!
Up on the altar!{end}

What ...!?{end}

Liana and ...
the Dark Princess, L{37}na!?{end}

It seems they're
the Maidens of Light
and Darkness ...{end}

The Maiden of Light
sealed away
the Dark Blade ...{06}{07}
So, logically, she'll
be needed to
unseal it as well.{06}{07}
Hmph, a good
enough reason to
have her around.{end}

Both of them are
needed for the 
revival ceremony ... {06}{07}
The Maiden of Light's
purpose I understand,
but what about the
Maiden of Darkness?{end}

She'll probably be
the conduit for darkness
to enter this world.{end}

Oh no ...!
If we don't hurry, they'll
finish the ritual!{end}

Yeah, you're right.{06}{07}
Before Alhazard
is revived, we must
defeat B{3a}ser.{06}{07}
Fight on, everyone!{end}

Well, well ... {06}{07}
It's those meddlesome
children who think
themselves an army.{06}{07}
Sorry, I can't allow
you to interfere.{06}{07}
Until the rites
have finished,
keep them at bay!{end}

My Dark Dragon Sorcerers
will make short work
of these meddlesome curs.{06}{07}
Concentrate on 
completing the ceremony.{end}

Heh, if you insist. {end}

Oh, my Alhazard!
Finally you've awoken,
flesh of my flesh!{end}

Heh heh ...
Looks like we're all
done, hmmm ...?{end}

Even ...{06}{07}
Even working together,
can we really
defeat Bernhardt?{end}

Everyone!
I'm locking away
Bernhardt forever!{06}{07}
I need to be close ...
Cover me
while I move in!{end}

Lady Jessica, that sounds
like an attempt at suicide.{end}

We have no
other choice.{06}{07}
We cannot defeat
Bernhardt while
he wields Alhazard.{end}

Lady Jessica ...{end}

Please, cover me!{end}

She's right.{06}{07}
Our options
are limited here.{end}

Very well.
All right, let's do it!{end}

Just a bit longer,
and Alhazard
will be reborn. {06}{07}
Watch carefully,
Lady Jessica.{06}{07}
This will be
quite a sight.{end}

I'm sure you're aware
of how foolish it
is to revive Alhazard. {06}{07}
You're playing into
the hands of darkness!{end}

My concerns are nothing
in relation to such
monumental power ... {06}{07}
In order to complete
my objective,
no action is too much.{end}

Heh heh heh ...
With this, my objective
will be complete.{end}

But ... Why, why
are you doing this!? {06}{07}
B{3a}ser's death
makes no difference!
You will merely take his
place like that last man ...{06}{07}
Don't you see?
He was once just
as you are ...{end}

Enough of your babble.{06}{07}
I will resurrect Alhazard,
and I will have the
strength to wield it.{06}{07}
It will yield to me!{end}

N, no!{end}

B{3a}ser!
There's nowhere left
for you to run!{06}{07}
Hell has a special
place for you!{end}

Hmph, no,
I'm afraid not.{06}{07}
It seems
you're too late.
How pitiful.{end}

Light's ward of slumber,
who now binds this weapon,
I implore thee ... {06}{07}
Dissolve thy binding,
and unshackle the
hatred of this blade ...{06}{07}
{font4}Fram Se
Dimm Ealdor ...
Sin Geweald Swithlic ...{06}{07}
{font4}Frymthe of Yfel ...
Herian Alhazard!{end}

Oh, no!
The seal!{end}

Cough ... wheeze ...
My sword ...
Alhazard ... is mine--!{end}

No! The sword's
been taken! {end}

Hmmm ...
Yes, it appears
you are quite weary.{06}{07}
This has all gone
according to my design ...{end}

What do you
mean by that, Egbert?{end}

Yes, what indeed ...{end}

Above the magical
device hangs a cracked bell.{06}{07}

Will you ring it?{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{06}{07}

Something above another
magical device disappears.{end}

Above the magical device
hangs a rust-coated plate.{06}{07}

Will you take it?{end}

The rust falls away to
reveal a finely-crafted shield.{end}

Obtained Odin's Buckler.{06}{07}

Something above another
magical device disappears.{end}

If you value your life,
give up the sword.{end}

It seems as
if I'm done for.{06}{07}
But you're a fool
if you think defeating
me ... means you can
wield this sword.{end}

It's really a
shame, isn't it?{06}{07}
His Majesty has broken
his contract with the
ruling god of darkness.{06}{07}
But in doing so, 
he has proved he is
worthy of Alhazard.{end}

I won't lose!
I will never lose to
you filthy humans!{end}

Ugh ... 
I guess ...
this is it ...{end}

Aargghh--!{end}

Ow--!{end}

Crap!{end}

Ugh--!
How careless
I was.{end}

Curses, 
I have failed ...{end}

Aah, ... what 
a sky ... So blue ...{end}

No--!
I, I'm dyi--{end}

I'm so sorry.
I can't stand ... not being
able to fight ...{end}

Ooh ...{end}

Soon ...
Soon Alhazard's
power will return!{end}

Yes, ... I suppose
I am fairly exhausted ...{06}{07}
Cough ... Fine, ...
I'll lend you the
sword for now. {06}{07}
Do with it whatever
you please ...
Hah hah hah ...{end}

Prince B{3a}ser!
U, ugh--!{end}

Hmph ... 
So this is Alhazard ...
Finally in my grasp!{end}

What's going on?
The enemy is fighting
against ... itself?{end}

Why would they
just start battling
one another?{end}

Egbert's been
planning this for a
while, it seems.{06}{07}
He's always used B{3a}ser,
but now he's
betrayed him outright.{06}{07}
With Alhazard's revival,
Egbert was able to
summon the Kaiser ...{06}{07}
And with B{3a}ser weak
from the ceremony,
Bernhardt was able
to overpower him.{06}{07}
Now, Bernhardt controls
the unsealed Alhazard.
Truly ... an astonishingly
well-executed operation.{end}

A well-thought plan,
if I do say so myself. {end}

Heh ... {06}{07}
However, it seems
we're not yet finished.
For you see,
you're still alive ...{end}

Bernhardt. you say ...?
Alhazard alone is fearsome,
but in his hands, doubly so.{06}{07}
However, we shall not lose!
If things keep going
as they are, then darkness
will rule this world.{end}

You want to
fight me?{06}{07}
Hah hah ...
You people certainly have
one-track minds.{06}{07}
Everyone,
arm yourselves!{end}

No, I couldn't ...
have lost--{end}

Aaah! 
For Imperial victory,
now and forever!{end}

It looks like this ...
is the end for me ...{end}

E, enough ...{end}

Cherish your
last moments!{end}

Pretty good ...
However, you can't hope
to kill me at this rate.{end}

We'll meet again,
ladies and gentlemen
of the Light.{end}

Now, B{3a}ser--
hand over Alhazard!{end}

Nonsense!
To relinquish it to
a mere child ...{end}

Huff ...
They weren't kidding about
how strong you are ...{end}

It's over for
you, B{3a}ser!{end}

Fools ...
You have no respect for
the value of life!{end}

Ugh, impossible--!
Was I that careless ...?{06}{07}
These shallow wounds ...
won't do me in ...!{end}

Send Bernhardt to
the other world, now!{end}

{font3}Ooohhh ...{end}

{font3}Oohhh--{end}

Time and space, be one!{06}{07}
Weavers of reality ...
since time immemorial,
I call upon thee!{06}{07}
Align thy gates
and rend them open!{06}{07}
{font4}Alfael Lea
Kaiser Ri Eglon!{end}

Well done, Egbert.{end}

Yes, my liege!{end}

What!?
It's ... Bernhardt!{end}

Hah ...
You, you're still alive?{end}

Heh heh heh ...
It seems you've met
my doppelg{38}nger.{06}{07}
Quite a spell.{end}

B{3a}ser ...{06}{07}
You were trying to use me,
but I'm afraid the tables
have been turned all along.{end}

Hah ... hah hah!{06}{07}
I wondered why you
Imperial scum buckets were
so eager to join me.{06}{07}
What amusing fools ...
to have planned a trespass
from the very start ...{06}{07}
But, in the end, your
ploy was quite moronic.{06}{07}
Do you see this sword
in my hand? I'm about to rend
you a new asshole with it!{end}

Impudent fiend.{06}{07}
It's quite obvious
the ceremony has
taxed you considerably.{06}{07}
I suspect you're
weak as a kitten
for the moment.{end}

Men of the Empire, as of now,
you will no longer pay heed
to these drooling monsters.{06}{07}
Kill B{3a}ser, and
kill all he commands ...{end}

His Majesty has returned!{06}{07}
We don't need to
take orders from these
animals any more.{06}{07}
Hell, there's no need
for them to even live!
Butcher them all!{end}

Men, I've been restored
to complete health.{06}{07}
As of now, you shall
turn a deaf ear to these
worthless monsters.{06}{07}
Massacre them all--
and don't spare
the red-haired brat!{end}

Yes, my liege!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

You rotten
son of a ...!{06}{07}
You humans will
end as piles of
meat and pulp!{end}

You rotten
son of a ...!{06}{07}
My minions,
teach them the meaning
of proper worship!{end}

Time and space, be one!{06}{07}
Weavers of reality ...
since time immemorial,
I call upon thee!{06}{07}
Align thy gates and
rend them open!{06}{07}
{font4}Irud Lea
Keser La Dore!{end}

So ... this is
the sort of thing
Alhazard can do ...{06}{07}
It seems as though
Lady Jessica's magic
didn't work properly ...{06}{07}
They appear to have
materialised at
Castle Velzeria.{end}

What ...?
What in the world
is going on?{end}

What's happening?{end}

Lady Jessica's magic
has sealed Bernhardt
in another world.{end}

Jessica has sealed
Bernhardt in another
world, it seems ...{end}

She used her own body as
a means to channel a large
amount of magical energy.{end}

Was that so ...?
Did it work?
Has he been defeated?{end}

No, it doesn't
look that way. {06}{07}
The Alhazard shone
forth a light, and
both disappeared.{end}

Egbert said
Castle Velzeria,
did he not ...?{end}

If Bernhardt's there,
then there's a good
chance Jessica's with him.{end}

According to what Egbert
said, the two
are in Castle Velzeria.{end}

Liana has been saved!{end}

Ugghh ...{end}

Huh? Liana!{end}

Aah, ... {02}!{end}

I'm so glad
you're safe ...!{end}

Liana joins the entourage!{end}

L{37}na also
seems all right.{end}

I, I ...{end}

It looks like
B{3a}ser's power
is no more.{end}

Sister! L{37}na!{end}

Liana?
Is it really
you, Liana?{end}

L{37}na, I thought I would
never get to see you ...{end}

I didn't know
Liana had a twin.{end}

By the way,
what am I
doing here?{end}

You were being
controlled by B{3a}ser.{end}

By ... B{3a}ser ...?{06}{07}
That's right, 
when I was but a child,
B{3a}ser abducted me and
would have taken Liana.{06}{07}
Gasp ... Alhazard!{end}

Bernhardt has it now. {06}{07}
But we have no
idea where he is.{end}

That is not a problem.
I can sense
Alhazard's aura.{06}{07}
And using that as
a reference, I shall quickly
find his location.{end}

...{end}

It ... seems 
as if Bernhardt is in
Castle Velzeria.{06}{07}
I can feel a strong,
dark presence there ...{end}

That makes sense.{06}{07}
I've heard that in
Castle Velzeria's foundation
sleeps the God of Chaos.{06}{07}
There's no question
that Alhazard has
been brought there.{end}

Let's hurry to Velzeria!{end}

Bernhardt has been
taken to Velzeria.
Let's hurry and follow them!{end}

Not yet.  Before we do that,
we need to remove the
seal placed on Langrisser.{06}{07}
The only thing that can defeat
the Glory of Darkness,
Alhazard, is the Sword of Light.{06}{07}
Langrisser's true power
is still sleeping. We've yet
to see what it can really do.{end}

What?
You mean it can be even
more powerful than it is?{end}

Amazing ...{end}

To awaken the sword,
we must retrieve the Holy Rod
that lies in Elrad.{end}

Please, let me help you.{end}

While I've been under B{3a}ser's
control, many innocent people
have been wounded and killed.{06}{07}
By fighting by your side ...
Maybe I can make amends
for some small part of that ...{end}

Master {02},
I've grown weary of the fight.{06}{07}
If you wish to take
L{37}na with you,
I'll entrust my share to her
and rest for a time.{end}

Would you like
L{37}na to join the entourage?{end}

You're welcome
to join us!{06}{07}
No one will look down on you
for what happened while
you were under B{3a}ser's control.{06}{07}
Let's go together!{end}

There's no need to worry.
The blame lies with B{3a}ser. {06}{07}
L{37}na, fight with us!{end}

Everyone,
thank you very much. {end}

L{37}na joins the entourage!{end}

All right, first we have
to get the Holy Rod. {06}{07}
Once we have it,
let's hurry and save Jessica!{end}

Very well.
Then I will do my best.{end}

If there's anything with
which you wish me to help you,
call upon me any time. {06}{07}
I'll be praying for
everyone's safety.{end}

All right, first we have
to get the Holy Rod. {06}{07}
Once we have it,
let's hurry and save Jessica!{end}

Oh, the pain ...{06}{07}
I've grown too old to fight.
I'll leave my duties
to this young one, L{37}na.{end}

Yes.{end}

Everything you've
done up until now has
not been your fault. {06}{07}
Never forget, you
were being
manipulated by B{3a}ser. {06}{07}
Now, the real question
is your future plan.
If it is okay, I suggest
you go with these fellows.{06}{07}
When I leave,
they're going to need
all the help they can get.{end}

Aaron, also well spoken.{end}

Yes!
I shall make up for
his absence.{end}

L{37}na joins the entourage!{end}

All right, first we have
to get the Holy Rod. {06}{07}
Once we have it,
let's hurry and save Jessica!{end}
