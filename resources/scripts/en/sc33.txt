Everyone, it's an ambush!
They're trying to board!{end}

Wh, what? 
We're under attack?{06}{07}
I haven't even gotten
my sea legs yet!{06}{07}
I guess there's
no helping it ...{end}

Listen up, you little rodents.
You won't get any further!{end}

It's General Imelda of
the Water Dragon Navy.
What's she doing here?{06}{07}
Are you trying to avenge
Bernhardt or something?{end}

No, not really.{06}{07}
It would be ... 
inconvenient if you
were to arrive in
Velzeria unharmed.{06}{07}
In fact, it would
be ideal if you could
die here and now.{end}

You're out of your
mind if you think
we'll just give up.{06}{07}
We'll defeat B{3a}ser
and prevent 
Alhazard's revival!{end}

Damn it.
This will be difficult,
as I anticipated.{end}

Hmmm, ... we're on water.
It's really too bad
you're fighting our Navy.{06}{07}
You'll be down to
the last man before
you know it!{end}

Hah hah hah.
Leave this to me,
Lady Imelda!{end}

This is the end for you!{06}{07}
Here, I crush your
cute little dreams of 
reaching Velzeria.{06}{07}
Gwa ha ha!{end}

Why are you against us?
Surely you're not acting
in B{3a}ser's interest!?{end}

Obviously, bowing down
to the Demon Tribe is
quite unbecoming of me.{06}{07}
However, I was told
to serve Lord B{3a}ser should
His Majesty perish.{06}{07}
The Kaiser's last request ...
If not for that,
I wouldn't share breath
with these fiends.{end}

What foolishness!{06}{07}
You mean you're consorting
with demons for the
sake of a dead man's wish?{end}

I will not
discuss this further.{06}{07}
Watch closely.
You're about to lose.{end}

{02},
this isn't the 
time to lay about.{06}{07}
If we don't hurry--!{end}

Yes, we need to act.
I'm aware of that.{06}{07}
Alhazard's revival
will be soon.
We need to move fast.{end}

You numbskulls!
Are you following the
enemy's orders or mine?{end}

Sorry, General!{end}

Quickly,
let them have it!{end}

Force them back!{end}

Little boy,
you've come a long way.{06}{07}
But your good
fortune is about to
permanently end.{end}

Don't worry.
I've been
underestimated before.{end}

This is it ...{end}

I'm done in ...
They were strong--
after all.{end}

It's no good ...
I'm ... I can't move.{end}

Damn.
How could this happen?{end}

A Navy shouldn't
lose on water ...{06}{07}
Well, so much
for specialisation.{end}

Ughh ...
My back--
My poor back.{end}

What?
My father's
techniques were ...{end}

Hmph, I've never
much cared for
being all alone ...{06}{07}
But, enough games.
You'll soon see what
makes a real general!{end}

Be honoured.
Not everyone gets
to be slain by me.{end}

You fool!
How dare you stand
against me!{end}

Gaahh--!
I wanted to die ...
somewhere beautiful ...{06}{07}
No, not here--
in this wretched sea ...
I won't die ... here ...{end}

Goodbye,
General Imelda.{06}{07}
You were a truly
fearsome opponent.{end}

Hey, look over there!
I see land!{end}

Land, there!
I see land!{end}

We're here.
This is Velzeria.{end}

We finally made
it to Velzeria ...{end}

So, this is where
they're hiding.{end}

Soon, they'll get
just what they deserve.{end}

Everyone ...
Velzeria is right
before our eyes!{06}{07}
We're going to
make it.
Don't despair!{end}

You will all die!{end}

Imelda ...!{end}

Ahhh--!
I can't let you
on this ship ...!{end}

Aahh ...{end}

I never imagined
you would be
so eager to die.{end}

Hee hee hee.
The revival
ceremony's near.{06}{07}
It's quite impossible.
You won't stop
Alhazard's revival,
no matter how you hurry!{end}

The enemy is
making poor progress. {06}{07}
Strike them while
they're at their
most vulnerable!{end}

Yes, leave
it to us!{end}

Glory to the Empire!{end}

I'll turn you 
into fish feed!{end}

Impossible ...{end}

Imelda ...!
Gaahhh!{end}

Ughh--!
I've fallen.{end}

Hah ...
I'm dead ...{end}

I, I'm sorry.
Goodbye ...{end}

I will defend
the General!{end}

What a pity ...{end}

I'll give my life
for our General!{end}

S, strong--!{end}

N, not bad ...{end}

This battle is over.
There's no more
reason to fight!{end}

Hah hah hah.
You really are such
a silly little boy.{06}{07}
Our Empire is one
of conviction. Its followers
will always gratefully
offer their lives.{06}{07}
And I won't shame it,
myself, or my men
by giving in to some
redheaded upstart!{end}

Bernhardt is dead.
The Empire's over with.{06}{07}
There's no point
in fighting a battle
for a lost cause!{end}

Haven't I told you?{06}{07}
Alhazard's revival
was His Majesty's
last request!{end}

What do you mean?{06}{07}
With the Kaiser
dead, why do you
need Alhazard?{end}
