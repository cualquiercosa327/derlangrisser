The young magician Hein
followed {02} on his

The Rayguard Empire and
B{3a}ser's forces of darkness were

superior magical skill.{end}

Hein followed {02}
and sided with the Empire.{06}{07}
Destroying Kalxath's
Army of Light was
tough on his emotions.{06}{07}
However, Hein firmly
believed in the Kaiser's vision
of an ideal world.{06}{07}
Without a doubt, the support
Hein brought to the field of war
wrought terror on his enemies.{end}

The young sorcerer
Hein stayed with {02}
until the very end.{06}{07}
His choice was self-gratifying,
having learnt many
new things along the way.{06}{07}
With his help, {02}
crushed the Empire, killed
B{3a}ser, and put an end to the
Descendants of Light.{end}

Though Hein's performance on
the battlefield was average, his
magic proved useful in the war.{end}

His remarkable research
on battle strategy was
spurred by his time with Scott.{06}{07}
Even the most rigorous battles
were won with minimal
damage due to Hein's superb
command of all forms of magic.{end}

The young magician's reluctant
bravery never gave out,
even during the toughest times.{06}{07}
After the war ended, Hein
decided to tour the continent
and polish up on his magic.{06}{07}
While travelling, Hein acquired
vast amounts of knowledge.
One can scarcely imagine
how powerful he has become.{end}

After several years had passed,
Hein returned to civilisation
to start his personal laboratory.{06}{07}
It was there where he began
his research into ancient magic.
Many of the forgotten spells he
recovered were very powerful.{06}{07}
Only a handful of
El Sallia's greatest wizards
could cast them.{06}{07}
Due to Hein's continued efforts,
Hein became the most powerful
known magician in the land.{06}{07}
Shortly thereafter, the
Council of Wizardry erected a
tower in Hein's honour where
he now lives happily.{06}{07}
Hein's name would be well
known by any student of magic
for generations to come as the
greatest Wizard of El Sallia.{end}

After several years had passed,
Hein settled down from his
journeys to start a laboratory.{06}{07}
It was there where he began
researching spells that were
safe and easy for novices
to cast. Hein created a book.{06}{07}
Hein's book became
an instant success, and
he enjoyed a comfortable
living on his profits.{06}{07}
Magic for All, his book,
made the lives of others
a little easier due to the
cantrips it taught.{06}{07}
Thanked by many, Hein became
a very popular Wizard amongst
civilians and inspired many
boys and girls to study magic.{end}

Perhaps from overestimating
his own powers, he frequently
injured himself in battle.{06}{07}
Almost losing his life a
few times, Hein decided it was
for the best to avoid conflict
and settled down.{end}

One day, after several years
passed, Hein created his own
laboratory in a remote hamlet.{06}{07}
It was here that he learnt the
secret spell of Rebirth, the same
spell Jessica used to live through
the generations of man.{06}{07}
No one is sure if Hein
decided to use the spell or not,
but he has not been heard
from for some time.{end}

After several years had
passed, Hein created a
laboratory of his own design.{06}{07}
It was in this laboratory
that Hein researched forbidden
magic for summoning creatures
of the nether realms.{06}{07}
Perhaps by overestimating his
control over his summons, Hein
lost control of a lesser demon
and was dragged into a vortex.{06}{07}
Hein has not been seen
or heard from ever since.{06}{07}
In the summoning circle Hein
created, a single iron dumbbell
lay slickened with Vaseline.{end}

attempt to govern the
land single-handedly.{06}{07}
Not only did it succeed, it
paid off big. Rohga could test his
might against B{3a}ser, the Empire
and the Descendants of Light.{end}

Although Rohga's skills were
not top-notch, his mere
presence was quite daunting.{end}

Rohga's almost savage
battle skills were unmatched
on the battlefield.{06}{07}
Cutting a bloody swath through
enemies, Rohga was one of the
most feared opponents during
this most excruciating war.{end}

And he who ravaged his
enemies bore not a single
wound from this conflict.{06}{07}
Rohga truly is, undeniably,
El Sallia's ultimate swordsman.{end}

However, still working on
his swordsmanship, Rohga was
wounded from time to time.{end}

After the war, Rohga examined
his overall objectives for
fighting with {02} ...{06}{07}
It all boiled down to trying to
convince his kid sister, Sonya,
to give up her hate for humans
fuelled by B{3a}ser's manipulation.{06}{07}
However, Sonya is no longer
in this world ... She died in front
of his very eyes, and Rohga
could not live with himself.{06}{07}
Grief-stricken, Rohga parted
with {02} and allies for
his own reasons and left on
a journey to the world's edge.{06}{07}
No one has
seen him since ...{end}

Though discomforted by her
coldness, Rohga was content
to be with his little sister.{06}{07}
Now under command of B{3a}ser,
Rohga fights an endless war
on humanity, but at least he
can be next to his sister, Sonya.{end}

Breaking through all odds,
Rohga never lost hope
for Sonya, rushing to her side.{06}{07}
Rohga successfully warmed her
heart, and together they lent
{02} power to build
peace for demons and humans.{end}

Being born as the holy

Through the support she
found in {02}, Liana
never faltered even under
extreme hardships.{06}{07}
Liana gladly helped {02}
take on the forces of evil and
stop the Empire's ambition.{end}

However, she could not endure
the excruciating battles.
Many times she was injured.{06}{07}
Unable to provide
her support, Liana burdened
{02}'s party at times.{end}

Even during the excruciating
battles, not once did she back
down. She fought till the end.{end}

Using support magic and her
healing prayers, Liana aided
{02}'s party greatly.{end}

She never made outstanding
achievements in battle.{06}{07}
However, her healing
magic enabled the party to
fight confidently and without
worry of dying.{end}

After the war, peace returned,
but the scars left by
it had made many orphans.{06}{07}
With her kindness, although
poor, Liana built an orphanage
and underwent many hardships.{06}{07}
Liana supported the
children in her care so that they
might have a better life.{end}

Liana's financial difficulties
came to an end when {02}
visited her a few years later.{06}{07}
During {02}'s journey,
he had single-handedly settled a
dispute between three states.{06}{07}
{02} donated the
money which he was awarded
to the orphanage.{06}{07}
Without the worries of
managing the orphanage,
Liana accepts {02}'s
request to go on a journey ...{06}{07}
The two travel to help rid the
continent of conflict so
the children might live in
a shining new era of peace.{end}

A wealthy man took pity on her,
asking her hand in marriage.{06}{07}
Though she married the
man, she never abandoned

praised as a saint.{end}

But she began anew as a
Dark Priestess. All who looked
at her could scarce imagine the
emptiness within her soul.{end}

Along with {02}, she
laid waste to the Imperial Army

Liana gave everything
she had to lead the
Forces of Darkness to victory.{end}

However, being unskilled
in battle, she could not
contribute anything major.{end}

After the battle, the continental
cleansing began under
B{3a}ser's Army of Darkness.{06}{07}
Her name became
synonymous with fear. The
people looked upon Liana as if
she was the Angel of Death.{end}

Later on, from some accidental
coincidence, B{3a}ser's

Realising what she had done,

and the Forces of Darkness.{06}{07}
Through this, she
helped restore peace
throughout the land.{06}{07}
She fulfilled her destiny
to protect Langrisser,
the Sword of Light.{end}

Cherie was a tomboy,
a strong-minded person, and
a gifted swordswoman.{06}{07}
Her achievements during
this war were only average,
although reassuring.{end}

At the sight of her charging
across the battlefield, people
praised her as an angel.{06}{07}
Thus, she bolstered the power
of her party and made
the enemy tremble in fear.{end}

She had been praised as the
best among the old
swordsman Aaron's pupils.{06}{07}
Not once was she badly
wounded during the long
excruciating battles.{06}{07}
What awaited her after the war
were peaceful days of boredom.
One day, when she had enough,
she finally fled the castle.{end}

Lately, there have been rumours
of a young and powerful female
warrior fighting for justice.{06}{07}
However, everyone knew that
girl was just Cherie
moonlighting as the
"Mystery Knight" again.{06}{07}
Knowing her nature, the people
knew sooner or later she would
become tired of the journey
and travel back to the castle.{end}

Before long, rumours spread
of a female fighter who claimed
to be the "Mystery Knight."{06}{07}
The fighter had single-handedly
defeated a rampaging dragon.
Keith sent a search party, but
she was no where to be found.{06}{07}
Knowing her nature, he knew
sooner or later she would
become tired of the journey
and travel back to the castle.{end}

Though sustaining deep wounds
from time to time, she
fought bravely as a woman.{06}{07}
This fact reflected just
as much in the eyes of the
people of Kalxath.{06}{07}
What awaited her after the war

Taken back to the castle,

trading overseas. {06}{07}
Gaining massive wealth
in the blink of an eye, this
allowed her to pursue her
luxurious way of life ...{end}

Although skilled at military 
tactics, she could not govern 
as well as she wanted to.{06}{07}
Due to this, her people
lived in poverty, but rumour
has it the people said nothing
out of fear of retribution.{end}

Imelda's selfish, extravagant
behaviour created resentment
in the hearts of the populous.{06}{07}
One day, after gulping
down  a bottle of liquor she
received, she suddenly fell
to the floor and died.{end}


{skip 70}{font4}S{font0}onya
{skip 21}{font4}G{font0}irl of the {font4}D{font0}emon {font4}T{font0}ribe{06}{07}
Her big brother Rohga finally
reached her heart, and Sonya
gladly joined the fight
for continental unification.{end}

{skip 17}{font4}F{font0}aithful {font4}S{font0}ervant of {font4}B{font0}{3a}ser{06}{07}
Saved by the Dark One, B{3a}ser,
from the persecution of humans,
Sonya chose the path of killing
for him and the Demon Tribe.{end}


{skip 70}{font4}S{font0}onya
{skip 21}{font4}A{font0}mbassador of {font4}E{font0}l {font4}S{font0}allia{06}{07}
Persuaded by Rohga and
{02} to fight along with
them, Sonya strove to achieve
peace for humans and demons.{06}{07}
{02} granted her the
rank of Ambassador
of El Sallia while she
travelled to and from Velzeria.{06}{07}
She worked hard for a world
where both races could
live peacefully without
any enmity for one another.{end}

Many had great expectations
for the new member,
though sadly, she let them down.{end}

She returned {02} and
the others' expectations as an
ally and continued to do so.{end}

It was then that
the Forces of Darkness
reigned in El Sallia.{06}{07}
The humans who persecuted her
now fawned on her for mercy.
Looking at the pitiful sight, she
saw her revenge was complete.{end}

Sonya learnt how to trust
from Rohga and {02}
and threw away her hatred.{06}{07}
The people of her home town
welcomed her after hearing of
B{3a}ser's scheme, and Sonya lived
happily along with her brother.{end}

Through her painful memories
and injuries, Sonya grew to fear
blood and slowly quit fighting.{06}{07}
What awaited her were the cold
reactions of humans. For she
who carries the blood of 
demons, peace is still far away.{end}


{skip 74}{font3}Esto
{skip 27}{font3}Sliver of Darkness{06}{07}
{font0}Being of a different nature,
even among the demons, Esto
used her skills as a parasite
to their full potential.{06}{07}
Esto fought for the Demon Tribe
along with Sonya to the end.{end}


{skip 74}{font3}Esto
{skip 35}{font3}Parasitic Justice{06}{07}
{font0}After regaining self-control
after B{3a}ser's death, Esto
fought for a world where
humans and demons could coexist.{end}

Skilful in unique combat styles,
Esto's ability brought
victory through many battles.{06}{07}
Later, Esto's abilities had been
recognised, and she was chosen
lead the demons that were
in {02}'s Navy.{end}

Esto's unique abilities that
came with her creation
are diminishing over time.{06}{07}
When B{3a}ser's spell
has fully worn off, Esto will
most likely lose her life.{end}


{skip 72}{font3}Osto
{skip 34}{font3}Nightmare Diver{06}{07}
{font0}Being parasitic made Osto
unique, even among demons,
but he fought against many foes
for the Demon Tribe's glory.{end}


{skip 72}{font3}Osto
{skip 51}{font3}Virus Eater{06}{07}
{font0}When the spell cast upon Osto 
was broken, he, with Sonya, 
fought for a world where
demons and humans can coexist.{end}

Osto's parasitic abilities aided
in organising troops and
lead his companions to victory. {06}{07}
Later on, Osto's power was
rewarded as he was appointed
commander of the Demon Tribe
units in {02}'s Army.{end}

However, one of Osto's wounds
had damaged his nucleus and
he lost his parasitic abilities.{06}{07}
When his current host dies, 
that will probably be
when his life will end as well ...{end}

{skip 34}{font4}H{font0}arbinger of {font4}P{font0}eace{06}{07}
{02}, heir of Baldea's
royal family, embraced destiny
and fought for his ideal world.{06}{07}
The wars plaguing El Sallia
since ancient times had been
brought to a climactic end due
to {02}'s efforts.{06}{07}
In his battles, {02}
gained something important.
He gained friends he could
trust with his life.{end}

Evaluating himself after the
war, {02} found
he was lacking in power.{06}{07}
Having relied on the help
of his companions more often
than not, {02} felt he
had to strengthen himself.{06}{07}
One day, early in the morning,
his bed was already vacant.
Yes, {02} set off
on another aimless journey.{06}{07}
His accomplishments during
this endeavour have
since passed into legend ...{end}

However, due to his wanderlust,
{02} disappeared
from his bed one night.{06}{07}
Perhaps he left on yet
another adventure.
No one knows for sure.{06}{07}
Three years later, a
treacherous war threatened to
split El Sallia in two again.{06}{07}
It was then that a
young traveller arrived and
is said to have subdued the
conflict within days.{06}{07}
The youth never mentioned
his name, but stories
say he wore a silver
tiara shaped like a wing.{06}{07}
The rest has been
passed into legend.{end}

However, in war, he was saved
numerous times by his
allies and had difficult victories.{06}{07}
Feeling his weakness,
{02} left on a journey
before anybody noticed, as if
running away from his friends.{06}{07}
Nobody knows what
has happened to him since ...{end}

The ancient struggle between
Light and Dark had finally
concluded with B{3a}ser
and {02} as the victors.{06}{07}
Langrisser's holy power that
{02} wielded in his
murderous onslaught vanished.{06}{07}
The reign of Chaos had begun.{06}{07}
When the cleansing of El Sallia
was complete, wars ceased as
no one was left alive to fight.
All were obedient to B{3a}ser.{06}{07}
{02} lived through the
will of B{3a}ser and ruled the
human realm from the
throne of Castle Rayguard.{06}{07}
The rule of a common enemy
finally gathered enough rebel
factions to form a raid
against Castle Rayguard.{06}{07}
The leader and his massive
force invaded Castle Rayguard
to stop {02}'s reign.{end}

Though no longer commanding
Langrisser, {02} was
powerful and managed to win.{06}{07}
However, due to the injuries
he sustained from the battle,
he died a lonely death a
couple of years afterwards.{06}{07}
{02}'s demise did
not create a ripple in the death
grip B{3a}ser held on the world.
The age of Chaos continues.{end}

Though no longer commanding
Langrisser, {02}'s
strength was enormous.{06}{07}
The blood of the invaders
covered Castle Rayguard's
walls as {02} ended all
opposition to his rule.{end}

However, without Langrisser,
{02} was weak.{06}{07}
Captured by the rebels,
{02} was executed for
crimes against humanity before
many cheering spectators.{06}{07}
The day when humans
may again find freedom
is getting closer ...{end}

With {02}'s team and
Alhazard, the Empire
successfully achieved its
goal of unifying the continent.{06}{07}
With both the great Langrisser
and the dreaded Alhazard,
the Empire was invincible.{06}{07}
{02}'s contributions
were recognised and he
became General of the Empire's
Radiant Dragon Knights.{end}

Since many nations are
still plotting against the Empire, 
{02} cannot relax.{06}{07}
However, {02} still fights
to this day, wishing for 
the time in which there are
no more wars on the continent.{06}{07}
Signs of a peaceful era to
come will arrive soon, without
a doubt thanks to {02}'s
determined efforts.{end}

There were no countries brave
enough to defy the Empire, so
there was no reason to fight.{06}{07}
But that was the world which 
{02} and Leon wished
for, a world without warfare.{06}{07}
As long as the Empire remains
strong, no wars will break out. 
And so, the curtains
have opened on a new era ...{end}

Battles continue daily due to
the existence of many countries
plotting against the Empire.{06}{07}
{02}'s lack of power
left him with little to do but sit
idly by and hope for the best.{06}{07}
Being rumoured as the Empire's
waste, he goes through his
days standing by in his room. {06}{07}
However, a sign of the
peaceful era to come should
be seen some day soon ...{end}

{skip 39}{font4}K{font0}ing of {font4}E{font0}l {font4}S{font0}allia{06}{07}
With Langrisser in his hand,
{02} seemed invincible
as he tore through opposition.{06}{07}
{02} fought the Empire,
the Army of Darkness, and the
Descendants of Light and took
leadership of the continent.{06}{07}
He entrusted the Army to
Rohga, the magic guilds to
Hein, and the peace talks with
the Demon Tribe to Sonya.{06}{07}
{02} works tirelessly,
striving to keep the peace in
El Sallia. Soon, people would
appreciate a world with no war.{end}

The peace negotiations
with the separatist states
are still proceeding ...{06}{07}
The time when peace
will be reality is
still some time away.{end}

His burden was lightened when
negotiations with the separatist
states ended in his favour.{06}{07}
The day had finally come when
war ended across the continent
in a shining new era of peace,
thanks to {02}'s effort.{end}

{02}, who is now a
monarch, always thinks of one
person when he's alone ...{end}

He thinks of Liana, who died
in battle. {02} swore
the world's peace to her.{06}{07}
{02} burdened himself
with the task of striving for the
happiness of the people.{end}

He thinks of the young girl,
Liana, whom he has never met
since that fateful day.{06}{07}
As soon as he heard that she
built an orphanage, he sent aid
to similar facilities and helped
rebuild in the aftermath of war.{end}

The seal of Chaos's Glory,
Alhazard, is still broken, and
countless men lust for power.{06}{07}
Was the unification by force
only peaceful in appearance?
{02} still fights to
keep Alhazard from evil hands.{end}

Years later, the Red Star
once again rose over
Yeless's sky in the west ...{06}{07}
The legends say that when this
occurs, a man of ambition is
set to make his mark on history.{06}{07}
A few months after the sighting
of the Red Star of Legend,
Castle Rayguard's gates were
shockingly blown wide open.{06}{07}
A cloaked figure surging
with power took Alhazard despite
{02}'s best efforts.{06}{07}
Now, El Sallia's ancient curse
rages on without the legendary
Descendants of Light to band
together and fight against it.{06}{07}
Many wondered if the
world would once again plunge
into an age of darkness.{06}{07}
{02} and Leon
allied once more on a quest
to exterminate the evil forever.
And the rest is all legend ...{end}

Legends of the King of Peace,
{02}, will be passed on
as the "Art of Swords War."{end}
