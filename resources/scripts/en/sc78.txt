Is this the
Muscular Shrine?{end}

Errr, {02}.{06}{07}
I don't think we should
investigate further ...{end}

I agree with Hein.{06}{07}
While we're hanging around,
the Imperial Army could
retrieve the Holy Blade.{end}

Aaaahh--!
What is this?{end}

Ugh--!{end}

Aarrghh--!{end}

Ooooh ...!{end}

Sampson! You should
train your body more!{end}

Sorry, big brother!{end}

Welcome to
the Muscular Shrine!{06}{07}
Huuhn huuh!{end}

We've been waiting for you!
Aaahhh hyah!{end}

I'm sorry, but you
have to die here.{06}{07}
We'll escape this cave
and conquer the world
with love and muscles!{06}{07}
Hooo ho yaahhh!{end}

What the hell!{06}{07}
{02}, they're going to
try and take over the world
if we don't do something!{end}

You're right.{06}{07}
We can't have these guys
messing with things.
Everyone, let's go!{end}

Or we could not ...
and say we did?{end}

Now it's our turn!
Apostles of Aniki, go!
Hunn huuh!{end}

Yeah!{end}

You see our muscles?
Oh yeah!{end}

Errr ...
I have a bad feeling ...{end}

Hey, little boy there!
You look too much like
a puny little girly man!{06}{07}
Give me twenty push-ups
and fifteen sit-ups when
you're done with those!{06}{07}
Come on! Four laps,
up and down the stairs!{end}

I can't understand
a word he's saying ...{end}

It's the language of
brotherly love and muscles.{06}{07}
If you keep working on that
figure, maybe you'll be
manly enough to make it out!{end}

Zero!{end}

This is it!
Everyone, run for cover!{06}{07}
There's no telling what
their {font4}Sexy Beam{font0} will do.{end}

Whew!
That's enough of a workout
for one day.{end}

Noooooo--!{end}

Ooh ...!{end}

What just happened?
He ... self-destructed?{end}

They posed in the
same position for so long that
their veins snapped ...{06}{07}
Or something like that ...{end}

Liana, you're came up
with that answer pretty fast.{06}{07}
Is there something
you want to tell us about ...?{end}

One!{end}

Two!{end}

Countdown started!
Three!{end}

That sounds bad ...!{end}

{font4}Sexy Beam{font0} energy
charged to one-hundred twenty
eight percent and counting!{end}

What the hell!{06}{07}
It's one-hundred twenty
eight percent from
the very start!? No way!{end}

{font4}Sexy Beam {font0}
energy charge initiated.{end}

A mysterious stone is fit
into a strange statue.{06}{07}

Will you touch it?{end}

The stone
shines like gold.{06}{07}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

There are water drops on
the man-shaped sculpture.{06}{07}

Will you taste some?{end}

Your body became harder.{06}{07}

DF raised by 1!{end}

The manly sculpture is wet with
some liquid that smells sweaty.{06}{07}

Will you dare to taste some?{end}

AT raised by 1!{06}{07}

But now you smell
like unwashed gym socks ...{end}

The flat-looking sculpture
before you begins to speak.{06}{07}

"Do you know who I am?
Do you dare to call my name?"{06}{07}

What name will you call?{end}

God{end}

Uminin{end}

Umineko{end}

"Incorrect ..."{06}{07}

The sculpture fell silent.{end}

"Correct ..."{06}{07}

AT raised by 2.{end}

"Incorrect ..."{06}{07}

The sculpture fell silent.{end}

There's a dumbbell made of
iron where Varan was standing.{06}{07}

You take it with your hands
and feel it is quite heavy.{06}{07}

Perhaps this is how the
Aniki became so powerful ...{06}{07}

Will you take it with you?{end}

Obtained Iron Dumbbell.{end}

Damn it ...
Their Vaseline-oiled muscles
deflected my swor--{end}

Hah hah hah, boys!{06}{07}
You've got to train
your body more!{06}{07}
Oooohhh yeah!{end}

I knew I wasn't pumped
enough to take
on Masaya's Aniki  ...{end}

No! I don't want to be
a big muscle-bound moron.{end}

Don't worry, young lady.
It only hurts the first time.{06}{07}
Uuuhnnn hah!{end}

No! Don't come near me!{end}

I can't believe an Aniki
is going to be the last thing
my eyes ever see ...{end}

I can't do this any more.{end}

This must be a dream ...
So many Aniki ...
Someone wake me up--!{end}

My crocodile ...
Where have you gone?{06}{07}
Why did Masaya forget to
add you to this game ...?{06}{07}
I hope that wherever
you are, you're ... free .....{end}

So manly and dreamy ...{end}

{font4}Je t'aime.{end}

{font4}Senorita!{end}

Oh no!
They managed to break my
invincible pose ...{end}

Look at meee!{end}

{font4}Aniki!{end}

Pump it up!{end}

You'll never leave a
scratch on my ultimately
trained iron body!{end}

I ... I am beautiful ...{end}

Nice body ...
I should admire it even
though you're the enemy ...{end}

Nooo!{end}

Nooo!{end}

Hey there, I'm Adon!{end}

Sampson, Sampson!{end}

Nice body!
I'm Sampson!{end}

Adon, Adon!{end}

Oooohh ...
You're not too bad, boys!{06}{07}
Adon, Sampson, get ready
for the {font4}Sexy Beam!{end}

Okay, big brother.{end}

{font4}Sexy Beam?{06}{07}
{font0}I don't know what it is,
but it sounds like
nothing but trouble!{end}

Hurry! We have to stop
them before they can fire it!{end}

{font4}Sexy Beam?{06}{07}
{font0}I don't know what it is,
but it sounds like
nothing but trouble!{end}

Is that all ...?
So this is the end of
the Aniki's ambition.{06}{07}
Their conquest of
our world was over before
it even began.{06}{07}
I am still wondering
about that {font4}Sexy Beam{font0} ...{end}

{02}.{06}{07}
I told you coming here
would just be
a waste of our time!{end}

At any rate ...
It is time to be
on our way.{06}{07}
Let us never
speak of this again.{end}
