The enemy is persistent!
We've been cut off!{end}

We'll engage them
on our terms.{end}

The Empire ends here!{end}

You can't run any longer!
Or perhaps you
intend to jump out to sea?{end}

Swimming in armour
can't be very easy.{end}

Vargas was defeated, I see ...
These guys are pretty good.{end}

In order to aid His Majesty's
recovery, I administered
him a sleeping drought.{06}{07}
If we fight them now,
it will be very difficult.{06}{07}
Laird, do all you can.
Halt the enemy's advance!{end}

Yes, General Leon!{end}

We'll finish you for Vargas.
He deserved far better than
to die by the likes of you.{06}{07}
Do you hear that?
We, the Water Dragon Navy,
shall crush you to pulp!{06}{07}
Egbert, while I'm dealing
with this whelp ... Please
take the others to safety.{end}

Very well.
I'll see to it.{end}

Do you think we'll
just let you run?
Why do you think we're here?{end}

This isn't how I
usually fight, but we're
trying to buy time.{06}{07}
We don't need to move an inch.
Hold your positions and engage
the enemy as they come!{end}

Understood!{end}

Smash their weak spot
and thwart this invasion!{end}

Yes, we'll break
the enemy's front line!{end}

...{06}{07}
Please look after
the Kaiser, Egbert.{end}

This has turned into
a bloody conflict ...{end}

General Imelda,
we have just returned
from reconnaissance.{end}

Hmmm, what's going on?{end}

You've returned
just in time.{06}{07}
Flank the enemy
from the rear, all of you!{end}

Understood!{end}

Damn it. Reinforcements?
We could do without those.{end}

My exit should
be here soon.{06}{07}
But I don't know if ...
No, we must keep fighting!{end}

My exit should
be here soon.{06}{07}
If we keep this pace,
I may be able
to wait things out.{end}

Sorry we've kept you, Imelda.
We're ready for you now.{end}

Hah hah hah hah ...
So you had a little
preparatory meeting, did you?{06}{07}
Getting all ready
for the great Imelda!
Boys, it's been fun!{06}{07}
Now, how would you like
to play on the water?{end}

{02}, there's a
nice welcoming army waiting
for you on the continent.{06}{07}
I think you'll be pleasantly
surprised by its numbers.
Please, look forward to it.{end}

Damn this!
We took too long ...!{end}

Imelda, your time is up.{end}

Hah, don't speak so
casually of my death.{06}{07}
I'll be around long after
you taste dirt, {02}.{end}

How could I lose ...{end}

Argh! You got me ...{end}

God damn it!{end}

Aarrghh ...!{end}

{font3}Ooohh ...{end}

{font3}Aaahhh--!{end}

Payback is cruel,
wouldn't you say, Leon?{end}

Leon, I don't want to
take your life.
Surrender, please!{end}

I thought this fight
was inevitable.{end}

Ugh, my strength is ...{end}

I, I haven't lost yet ...!{end}

Liana, don't be foolish!
Get out of here!{end}

Very well ...
If you think so, then ...{end}

Wh, when did you ...?{end}

Grrr, no!{end}

Wh, what are
you doing, Egbert?{end}

Though it pains me to say
so, I must teleport His Majesty.
There is no alternative.{end}

That's a tremendous strain ...!
His Majesty is far too weak!{end}

Thanks to the sedative,
His Majesty sleeps soundly.{06}{07}
In this state, the process will
be far less stressful.
He should endure it well.{end}

It's our only option.{end}

That's true.
There's nothing else ...{06}{07}
All we can
do is attempt it.{end}

Yes, precisely.
Now, let's begin.{end}

Okay. It's up to you.{end}

This is pretty bad, {02}!
They're planning on
teleporting to escape!{end}

You think you can get
away with a teleport spell?{end}

Everyone, I'll buy more time.
Get ready to escape.{end}

All right, Leon.
Now it's your turn.{end}

Please send Laird first.
I don't mind going after him.{end}

But ... General Leon!{end}

You will move ahead
and protect His Majesty.
This is an order.{end}

...{06}{07}
Very well ...{end}

Well then,
Laird, you're next.{end}

I wonder how long
I can hold out here ...{06}{07}
Hmph, that isn't like me!
I'll focus on slaughtering every
last one of the curs!{end}

Leon, it is your turn.{end}

Egbert, if you would ...
Please send
the others ahead.{06}{07}
After all, I've handled
graver battles than this.{end}

Do not forget your duty.{06}{07}
You are the leader of the
Blue Dragon Knights,
the retainer of His Majesty.{06}{07}
No one can replace you,
not even Laird.{end}

...{end}

Let's go, Leon.
Opposition shall not
be tolerated.{end}

Very well.
Get on with it.{end}

Sorry to have kept you, Imelda.
I'll send you off at once.{end}

...{06}{07}
Hah ... hah hah!
What kind of joke is this!?{06}{07}
You can't zap off a thousand
people in a row! If you have
any strength left, save yourself!{end}

The Kaiser will need
his chief counsellor, Egbert.{06}{07}
Take the advice
you gave to Leon.{end}

A counsellor and his Kaiser
should always stick close,
wouldn't you agree?{06}{07}
If you can't
do it, who shall?{end}

...{06}{07}
Forgive me ...
Once my power returns, I will
come for you. I swear it.{end}

Now that those annoying
gentlemen are out of the way,
it's time for the main event!{end}

Ugh ...
If we don't hurry ...{end}

Imelda, please take care.
I will return for you.{end}

Why have you come?
If you hadn't, I wouldn't
have drawn my sword.{end}

{02}, is it?
You are unfit to
share the Kaiser's air!{06}{07}
Prepare to die!{end}

What's wrong? Had enough?
What a weakling
you are, traitor {02}!{end}

Ugh!{end}

Grr, no!{end}

Aaarrrghh!{end}

Grr, no!{end}

General Imelda ...,
your forgiveness ... 
please ...{end}

I'll take
care of you, kid.{end}

Until Egbert sends
everyone off, I will not die!{end}

General Imelda!{end}

Uugghh ...
I didn't make it ...{end}

Ah hah hah, how foolish!
Why is your face so pale!?
I'm not even through with you!{end}

Egbert, what are you doing!?
Get out of here now!{06}{07}
Do you want to render my
efforts completely useless?{end}

...{06}{07}
All right.
I'm going.{end}

Watchers of time and space ...
Honour your ancient pledge
and send us to another land ...{end}

Hah ... hah hah ...!{06}{07}
My allies escaped, but ...
the Queen of the Seas,
she's going to ... die here?{06}{07}
A bad deal ...
But maybe not.{06}{07}
That bald-head Vargas ...
He is already waiting for
me in the next world.{06}{07}
Maybe I can be ...
the Queen of Hell ...
Ah hah ... hah hah ...{end}

So this ends the
Water Dragon Navy ...?{end}

We don't have time to rest.
We must go after everyone who
escaped with Egbert!{end}

But where did Bernhardt
and the others run off to?{end}

Do you know?{end}

Twin Castle, maybe.{06}{07}
It's the former stronghold
of the Dalshis Empire.{end}

We can get
there with this boat.
Let's hurry!{end}

Yes.{06}{07}
They've evaded us
long enough.{end}

All right.
Destination, Twin Castle.{end}

I should be invincible
in the ocean ...!
{end}

B, bastards ...{end}

My mounted troops ...{end}

I won't let peasants
like you touch His Majesty!
Have at you!{end}

Aarrggghhh ...!
How could I lose to a
bunch of monsters ...{end}

Did I pick the
wrong weapon ...?{end}

Why couldn't I win ...?{end}

No ...
At the least, I wanted to join
Leon, Laird and His Majesty.{end}

No ...
At the least, I wanted to
join Leon and Laird.{end}

No ...
At the least, I wanted
to be with Leon ...{end}

Watchers of time and space ...
Honour your ancient pledge and
send them to another land ...{end}

There's no need to worry.
With Egbert's spell, they all
must arrive in one place.{end}

The Empire's re-entry
point is Twin Castle.{06}{07}
Long ago, a king who
stole the power of
Langrisser lived there.{end}

Watchers of time and space ...
Honour your ancient pledge and
send them to another land ...{end}

All right.
We will expect you.{end}

Watchers of time and space ...
Honour your ancient pledge
and send me to another land ...{end}

Until Egbert returns,
we cannot die!{end}
