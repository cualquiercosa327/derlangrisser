General Keith!
Imperial troops have laid
siege to our castle!{end}

Even with my years of
experience, they still caught
us by surprise ...{06}{07}
Somehow ...,
we have to hold out until
the princess returns.{end}

General Vargas!
It seems our diversion
was a success.{06}{07}
Kalxath took the bulk of
its forces to defend the shrine.
The garrison left will
be no match for us.{end}

Colonel Zorum and Morgan did
surprisingly well as a team.
I'll have to pair them again.{06}{07}
Soldiers of the
Blazing Dragon Army,
the time has come to end
Kalxath's meddling!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

General, Sir!
We have a problem.
The enemy is at our rear!{end}

What--!?{end}

It looks like
we're not too late.{end}

It's the princess!
Everyone, our princess
has returned!{end}

Huzzah!{end}

Wha--!?
The princess ...?{end}

Keith, everyone!
Thank heaven you're all safe!{06}{07}
It's just like Rayguard sleaze
to attack while I was away.{end}

"Rayguard sleaze?"
Miss, it seems you have no clue
as to what "strategy" is.{06}{07}
If you can't recognise
such basic tactics, then
you are indeed a moron.{end}

M, moron ...!?
You muscle-bound creep,
I won't forgive such an insult!{end}

So you mean ...
Cherie is ... the princess ...
of Kalxath ...!?{06}{07}
Sigh ...
My image of a "princess"
is thoroughly smashed ...{end}

What was that--!?{end}

Oh ...
N, nothing ...{end}

Enough bickering.
We must attack immediately!{06}{07}
Without any backup,
the castle soldiers can't
repel Rayguard for long.{end}

Thank you!
I appreciate your help.{end}

Finally, a chance to put all
my years of study to use.{06}{07}
The Blazing Dragon Army, the
Blue Dragon Knights, the
Dark Dragon Sorcerers,
and the Water Dragon Navy ...{06}{07}
These four divisions constitute
the main force of the
Rayguard Imperial Army.{06}{07}
General Vargas is an
extraordinary military officer
and a man to be feared.{06}{07}
If such a major division of the
Imperial Army has been sent
here, the Empire must be set on
crushing Kalxath.{end}

Of all nations in El Sallia,
only Kalxath is a strong enough
power to oppose Rayguard.{06}{07}
As long as our kingdom holds
strong, the Empire will never
be able to conquer El Sallia.{end}

All elite units, there's
no time to waste!
Take the castle, double quick!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

All other troops, engage
the enemy at our rear!{06}{07}
We must keep them out until
we have taken the castle!{end}

Understood!{end}

Kalxath is the dominant
force in the the
League of Anti-Imperialists.{06}{07}
If Kalxath falls, its allies
will capitulate, one by one,
to our Empire's power.{06}{07}
If we succeed here, it will
only be a matter of time
before all of El Sallia is
united under Imperial control.{06}{07}
Give it your best, men!
For the glory of
the Rayguard Kaiser!{end}

Somehow, ...
everyone is still holding out.{end}

We need to hurry!{end}

Castle Kalxath has endured
this long, but ...
Everyone, we must hurry!{end}

Since the enemies are strong,
we'll need to use magic attacks.{06}{07}
Unleashing a magic attack from
a distance will weaken them
enough to give our soldiers an
opportunity to strike.{06}{07}
If we rush in and count
on our strength alone to
overpower them, many of
our men will die in vain.{end}

I see.{end}

When the enemy attacks,
try to form a wall using troops
that give us an advantage.{06}{07}
Don't try to be a hero
by engaging the enemy alone.
You'll only receive damage
instead of dealing it.{end}

So after you guys block
them, I should cast Fireball
and Attack, right?{end}

That's right.
Every enemy loss will increase
our chance of victory.{end}

Through a window,
you spot a bird's nest.{06}{07}

Rooting through the feathers
in the bottom, you find a flask.{06}{07}

The liquid in the flask seems
to be the colour of the sea ...{end}

Will you drink the potion?{end}

DF raised by 1 point!{end}

Let's go!{end}

Bah!
I'll take you all down!{end}

Ugh ..., from now on ...{end}

Defeated ...
It seems I'll be leaving the
lines before you ...{end}

Imperial troops!
Don't be so haughty!{end}

Shit!
If only I had more power--!{end}

So you're General Vargas of
the Blazing Dragon Army!{06}{07}
Let's see how skilled
you really are!{end}

I like your spirit, boy!
By what name are you called?
I'll carve it on your gravestone.{end}

Fuck you!
The name is Rohga.{06}{07}
I'll be sure to inform your
wife that was the name of the
man who killed you!{end}

Hah!
What a brazen lad!{end}

God damn it, move!
You weaklings are in my way!{end}

To think that I, Rohga,
the great mercenary,
am going to die here ...{end}

We do better when
we cooperate.{06}{07}
{02}!
For this battle, I'll follow
your orders.
What would you have me do?{end}

To have fallen at the
castle I came to protect ...{end}

I cannot permit you to
attack my castle!{end}

Please!
Just take your troops and
leave this country!{end}

You're brave, girl.
Sadly, you think too highly
of your ability.{end}

I'm sorry ...
I ... can't ... any more--{end}

We'll fight to the last man!{end}

Yeah!{end}

Princess, my failure
is inexcusable ...{end}

Keith!{end}

We can't lose now that
our princess has returned!{end}

This is not a place
for you to trespass.
Go away!{end}

P, princess--!{end}

I'll show you what the
Kalxath army can do!{end}

Well then, let's see
what you're made of!{end}

I ...
I can't hold out any more.{end}

Don't relax your guard!{06}{07}
Even if Kalxath is just a
frontier country, they're
no stranger to battle!{end}

Taste the power of
an Imperial general!{end}

Show me the might
of Kalxath's army.{end}

Ugh ...
I don't think I can go
on any longer ...{end}

Damn, I'm an idiot.
I was too careless ...
Cough ...{06}{07}
I have to retreat!
Everyone, don't stop the
attack--no matter what!{end}

Gah--!
How can this be?{end}

G, General Vargas ...{end}

How regrettable ...
To fall in such a place ...{end}

I don't want to die ...{end}

Let me through!{end}

Gah--!{end}

I've served for the glory of
the Rayguard Empire!{end}

My vision ...
is fading ...
Alas, poor me ...{end}

Gahhh--!
Not bad ...{end}

Colonel Zorum, retreat!
I'll handle the rest.{end}

B, but, General ...{end}

I can't let you die
in such a battle.
Not like this ...{06}{07}
Retreat and reorganize
your troops.
Remember, as a soldier, your
fate is mine to decide.{end}

W, well then ...,
I'm retreating ...{end}

El Sallian brats!
Don't think you've won!
Our fight isn't over!{end}

Oh, I just remembered.
There's this report I've been
meaning to make to Egbert.{end}

Commander Morgan!?{end}

Hey you!
Cover me, I'm departing.{end}

Wh, wh, what!?
If you leave things like this ...{end}

Don't worry, we still clearly
have the advantage.
Just keep on fighting.{end}

Then ... why are you fleeing
battle, Commander Morgan?{end}

Well, I'm fleeing because--
Hey, {font3}shut up!{06}{07}
{font3}{font0}I'm not running away!
I just have a very, very, very
urgent report to make.{06}{07}
Now hurry and get
back to die--err ...
"securing" my departure!{end}

You can't be serious ...{end}

Even with General Vargas here,
the situation worsens ...{06}{07}
Hmmm ...
I don't want to die here ...
I wonder what can I do ...{end}

Even General Vargas retreated.
It won't help if I stay here ...{06}{07}
I wasn't planning to die here ...
I wonder what else I can do ...{end}

Oh well, I'm leaving!
Hya ha ha ...{end}

Shriek!
Y, you caught up
with me already!?{end}

Gwa ha ha!
Well, let me thank you for
our last encounter ...{end}

Ugh ...
Such pain ... argh--!
Can't stop bleeding ...!{06}{07}
Gah--!
Master Egbert ...!{end}

Damn ...
Even him ...{end}

Now, go!
Teach them a lesson!{end}

Yes!{end}

Damn it!
Stop following me!{06}{07}
It's your job to fight those
nincompoops so I have time
to retr--uh, to depart!{06}{07}
Fight them ...
Or you'll regret it.{end}

Y, yes, Sir ...{end}

Let's go!{end}

Shriek!{end}

Eh?
What useless subordinates!{end}

Hmmm, those kids are
doing quite well.{06}{07}
I never expected them
to corner my troops.{end}

No way ...
I can't believe
Castle Kalxath is fallen ...{end}

Damn!
I was too late ...{end}

Ha ha ha!
Well done!
You're excellent soldiers!{end}

Ouch!{06}{07}
I wouldn't have come
here if I had known this
would happen.{end}

Hein, what are you saying?
You're a man, aren't you?
Hang in there!{end}

I'm a magician. Actual
combat isn't my thing.{06}{07}
Cherie, I think the reason
you're okay is because you're
manlier than most men.{end}

"M, manly!?"
How cruel!{06}{07}
I will never ever help
you again, Hein--
even if you need it!{end}

I can't be beaten here!{end}

P, princess!?{end}

I'm all right!
A scratch like that
won't kill me.{end}

For heaven's sake, please
don't fight so much. I can't let
our princess die here ...{end}

What are you saying?{06}{07}
I can't leave battle
while others are still
fighting desperately!{end}

Eeek!{end}

Damn it!
Liana's in danger!
Everyone, defend her!{end}

Such power is to be
expected of the Empire ...
But we shall not fall!{end}

Shit ...
You are doing quite well.{end}

You've already lost!{end}

Well done.{06}{07}
You protected this
castle from the
Blazing Dragon Army's attack.{end}

Even a girl like me can fight!
I can't stand having to
sit by while others fight!{06}{07}
{02}, please let
me come with you!{end}

Nobody's hurt?{end}

It's amazing we're safe.{end}

Thanks to {02}, we
were able to able to repel
Rayguard's assault.{end}

Princess ...
You should properly
thank {02}.{end}

I guess so ...{06}{07}
Hmm--!
Where'd that armour go ...?{06}{07}
I'm sorry, I must have
given it to someone.
I don't have it any more.{end}

Do I already have it?
Was it ... a dream?{end}

Ah, yes.
I present you with this suit of
armour from our ancestors.{06}{07}
It's probably not the strongest
armour, but it's very light and
provides very good defence.{end}

Obtained Dragon Scale.{end}

Thanks to you, I was saved.{end}

Thanks to you, I was saved.{end}

I'm sorry, Princess ...
My failure is inexcusable.{end}

It's all right, Keith.{06}{07}
You saved the castle
from the siege of the
Blazing Dragon Army.{end}

I've heard Kalxath described as
an enormous castle. Would
Liana be safe within its walls?{end}

Certainly!
You can leave her care to us.{end}

Well, then ...
I have fulfilled my duty.
I must return home now.{end}

Well ...
It seems my current experience
wasn't any help.{06}{07}
I should return to Salrath
and continue my studies.{end}

What a pity!
Scott, if you leave, who
will tutor me in strategy?{end}

Curses ...
I guess I have no choice.{06}{07}
It seems I'll have to study
troop affinity on my own.{end}

Well then, take care ...{end}

Scott leaves the entourage ...{end}

Sir {02}, a guest
has requested to see you.{end}

Sir {02}, a guest
has requested to see you.{end}

We meet again, {02}.{end}

Your Holiness!
Welcome.{end}

I've been investigating
some ancient manuscripts
archived in our shrine.{06}{07}
It seems I've found the source
of the Dark Blade's power.{end}

That's good ...
What do you mean its "power?"{end}

Alhazard houses an even
more terrible power than
we first suspected.{06}{07}
Not only does it raise its user's
abilities, but it also allows him
to contact the demon world.{end}

The demon world!?
But it is said no magician in
El Sallia possesses such power.{end}

Indeed, you are correct.{06}{07}
However, the manuscript says
when the sword combines with
the Dark Rod, it will become
capable of commanding demons.{end}

The Dark Rod?
Legends say one blast from this
wand can level a kingdom.{end}

If such a weapon is used, we
would have no way to resist.
What can we do?{end}

There is more to tell.
Alhazard has yet to
reach its full power.{06}{07}
The Dark Rod is necessary
to completely revive it.{end}

I see ...{06}{07}
That's why the Imperial Army
is searching so desperately for
the ancient scrolls.{end}

Couldn't Alhazard be used
without the Dark Rod ...?{end}

I don't think so ...
I have yet to discover where
the Dark Rod is enshrined.{end}

Then let us make haste
to the Rall River.{06}{07}
It's said a powerful magician
over seven hundred years old
lives there in seclusion.{06}{07}
If there is anyone in El Sallia
who knows about this
"Dark Rod," it must be she.{06}{07}
{02}, let's go together!{end}

Are you sure?
It may be better if you stay
here to defend Castle Kalxath.{end}

Unfortunately, the Empire's
new ambition is our priority.{06}{07}
If the power of Alhazard
is released, this castle
won't matter any more.{end}

Indeed.
I will accompany you as well.{end}

What?
You plan to come, too?{end}

Of course!
My charge is to defend
the princess of Kalxath.{end}

Keith joins the entourage!{end}

Then ... I guess you shall
be away to the river now ...{end}

We cannot allow the Empire
to do as it pleases.{end}

Yes, let us depart at once.{end}

I'll lend a hand, too!
I want to see this
legendary magician.{06}{07}
I wonder what kind
of person she is ...{end}

Okay.
Troops, prepare to set out.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Let's hurry!
We must obtain this
Dark Rod before the Empire.{end}

{02} ...{end}

Liana, please stay here.
The castle guards will be
able to protect you.{06}{07}
Within Castle Kalxath, you
needn't be afraid any more.{end}

That's right!
While you remain with us,
you'll be treated like a guest!{end}

No ... that's not it ...{06}{07}
{02} ...
I wish to go with you.{end}

What!
Liana, it will be dangerous ...{end}

...{end}

{02} ... don't worry.{06}{07}
The Rall River is a fairly
stable region that has gone
unclaimed by any kingdom for
over several hundred years.{06}{07}
Could it be ... you fear you
cannot protect her ...?{end}

...{end}

Fine ...
Liana, you must promise
me one thing.{06}{07}
If we are forced to engage
the Empire, you must
flee and return to Kalxath.
Understood?{end}

Thank you ...
I'm sorry to make such an
unreasonable request ...{end}

Princess, I'm ready.{end}

Well then, let's move out!{end}

I've caught up with you at last!{end}

Shit!
How could we have failed
to take Kalxath ...?{end}

How are you, Zorum?
I was worried.{end}

I'm sorry, General Vargas.{06}{07}
We both failed to acquire
the stone tablet and to lure
Kalxath's army away from home.{end}

Don't worry ...
What's done is done.{06}{07}
Concentrate on taking
Castle Kalxath now.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Hee hee hee ...
I have an interesting story
for you, General Vargas.{06}{07}
Have you heard of Liana,
the young girl Leon's forces
are scrambling for?
She was with those brats today.{06}{07}
We're in luck!
We can capture both her
and the castle ...
Hya ha ha!{end}

My orders are only to
capture Castle Kalxath.{06}{07}
Regarding this girl, Liana,
I have no interest.
I'll leave her to you.{end}

Hya ha ha!
I can't believe you
don't want her!{06}{07}
Well then, I'll capture her,
and then ... who knows ...
Hee hee hee.{end}

It seems that the
General has withdrawn.{06}{07}
We have no choice, then,
but to take this girl to the
Imperial Capital by ourselves.{end}

It seems that the
General has withdrawn.{06}{07}
We have no choice, then,
but to take this girl to the
Imperial Capital by ourselves.{end}

For once, we're on
the same page.{06}{07}
Okay, Morgan, let's go!{end}

Hee hee hee!{end}

Yeah ...
You can't depend on
others forever.{end}

I really must
be on my way ...{end}
