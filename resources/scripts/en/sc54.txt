It's true, then.
Sonya has turned
against us?{end}

{font3}Yes ...{end}

It seems mere humans
cannot fully embrace
the darkness.{06}{07}
As for her father,
I should have 
killed him sooner ...{end}

{font3}What ...!?
You've come here?{end}

Is Sonya dead ...?{06}{07}
Hmmm ... How disappointing.
She was of far
less use than I'd hoped.{06}{07}
But, she was sired
by her traitor of a father.{06}{07}
In fact, she's probably
meeting him as we speak.{end}

B{3a}ser! What were you
talking about just now?{end}

Heh heh ...
So you heard ...{end}

You ...{06}{07}
You murdered my father!?{end}

You're talking bull!
You think human lives
are worth nothing?{06}{07}
I'll never forgive you!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!{end}

B{3a}ser, you bastard!
Are you saying you
murdered Sonya's father!?{end}

Hmmm ...
What if I did?{end}

You worthless scum ...
I'll take revenge for Sonya!
I'm gonna beat your ass!{end}

You can't escape
this time, B{3a}ser!{06}{07}
Your ambition ends here!{end}

Hmph ...!
I won't be defeated
by mere insects.{end}

B{3a}ser, I allowed the
Dark Blade's resurrection
for the Empire's benefit.{06}{07}
I see it's been well cared for.
You have our thanks.{end}

Hah hah hah ...
How amusing.{06}{07}
Alhazard is mine alone!{end}

It certainly is ...
at least for the moment.{06}{07}
We shall reclaim
Alhazard for His Majesty!{end}

Interesting, ... the ceremony
has weakened me, but
they will not take Alhazard.{06}{07}
I will savour its
power for all eternity!{06}{07}
Go, my dark servants!{end}

Incredible ...{06}{07}
How were you able to
summon such a monstrous army
with one word ...{end}

Do you see?
This is Alhazard's power!{06}{07}
Do you really think you
mere humans can
compare to Chaos's Glory!?{end}

We've been through
far worse than you.{06}{07}
And don't forget,
we have Langrisser.{end}

Don't make me laugh.{06}{07}
Your worthless, incomplete
Langrisser shall
wither before Alhazard.{end}

I know not how our might
compares with the Descendants
you fought in the past.{06}{07}
We will just have to find
that out with our swords.{end}

Well then, you'd better
try your hardest!{end}

I admire that you've
reached the darkest
core of Velzeria ...{06}{07}
But this is not a
place for mortals.{06}{07}
And setting foot here has
sealed your death.{06}{07}
Come, my servants!
Play with them all you like.{end}

Grrrr ...
Persistent bastards.{06}{07}
Langrisser offers
humans such power ...{end}

Is that the best excuse
you can come up with?{end}

It's quite a miracle
that you've come this far.{06}{07}
But try any more and
suffer a pointless death.{end}

We'll see about that!{end}

Give up and crawl
back to your darkness!{end}

Wait, {02}!
Let me avenge ...
Sonya's death!{end}

You bastard ...
Toying with humans like
they were nothing!{06}{07}
For Sonya,
you deserve to die!{end}

In your ideal society,
the powerful give control
to the weak ...{06}{07}
So you wish to be El Sallia's
wet nurse, {02}?
Hah hah hah.{end}

Leave this world, B{3a}ser!
The sooner, the better.{end}

Damn it!
This world will be covered
in darkness ...{end}

I'm much stronger now!
There's no way I'll lose!{end}

Damn it!
Why now of all times!?{end}

Move! I have no
business with you!{end}

You've manipulated
Sonya all along!{end}

Sonya suffered greatly
because of you.{06}{07}
Accept your atonement!
You will pay with your life!{end}

How pathetic ...{end}

What fools ...
Sonya has always
detested humans.{06}{07}
Our goals aligned,
and I exploited that.
Nothing else.{06}{07}
However, if you're intent
on despising me,
you should know this ...{06}{07}
I was the one
who spread the plague
to your village.{end}

Sonya had to die ...
All because of you ...!{end}

Oh, is your dear
little sister dead?{06}{07}
Hah hah hah ...
I hadn't noticed.{end}

What did you say,
you son of a bitch?{end}

Never mind that.
I'll tell you something
really interesting ...{06}{07}
I was the one
who spread the plague
to your village.{end}

Sonya ...
You've spelled the
end for B{3a}ser!{end}

Leave it to me, brother.
We must try to stop this!{end}

Sonya, you've grown strong.
I have plenty of faith in you.{end}

B{3a}ser ...
Do you want to die
by my hand ...?{06}{07}
{02}, please!{end}

I know you've been pulling the
strings, dragging nations
into meaningless bloodshed ...{06}{07}
But now we'll
destroy you and purge
this world of evil!{end}

Amusing ...
You really think you
can defeat me?{06}{07}
A few worthless humans
will accomplish nothing!{end}

Ugghh--!
I've failed!{end}

Hmph ...
Your skills are disappointing.{end}

Ugh, such disgrace ...
I'll remember this!{end}

I won't allow my beloved
wife and daughter to glimpse
a world tained by you!{end}

Arrghh ...{end}

Those Descendants of Light
are quite unnecessary.{06}{07}
We will crush you with
the might of the Empire!
{end}

I've known of your resurrection
for a very long time ... and
as I've known, I've researched.{06}{07}
Fortunately, I discovered
some truly horrifying spells.{06}{07}
B{3a}ser, prepare to
be banished to eternity.{end}

Don't mock me.
Do you want to die?{06}{07}
You're so withered from
black magic, your standing
is an impressive feat.{end}

I won't die here.
This is my purpose ...{06}{07}
In order to end
the darkness, I've given
up my parents, my
lover ... everything!{end}

So this is Castle Velzeria ...
The dark energy is growing ...{end}

I won't say I'm
fighting for humans!{06}{07}
I want my brother
and I to have a peaceful
world to live in!{end}

How dare you
keep us fooled for
this long!{end}

I've suffered so much, ...
but I'll make you writhe
in more pain than I ever did!{end}

This is for my father!
You'll pay for deceiving
me all this time!{end}

Is your blood confused?
You can't defeat me.{06}{07}
But since you're so amusing,
I'll tell you something.{06}{07}
I was the one who spread
the plague to your village.{end}

Wh, what!?{end}

Yes. I also started the rumour
that you were strange,
that you wanted it to happen.{06}{07}
Stupid, naive humans ...
They really thought there
was an outbreak.{06}{07}
But no one was sick.
Mwa ha ha! The idiots!{end}

Because of you ...,
Because of you, I ...!{end}

No need for thanks.
I did it to initiate you, to
show you the darkness.{06}{07}
...{06}{07}
At any rate, the moronic
humans persecuted
you just as I planned.{end}

That, that can't be right!
All the suffering
I had to endure ...!{06}{07}
You ...
I'll make you writhe in worse
pain than I ever did!{end}

Uugghh ..., B{3a}ser!{end}

Sonya, don't endanger yourself!
Rest and leave him to me!{end}

Ugh ... All right.
Take care, Brother.{end}

Sorry ..., Brother.
I couldn't defeat B{3a}ser.{end}

It's okay!
I'll take him
out for you!{06}{07}
Rohga and Sonya,
both of you
deserve some rest!{end}

Thank you, {02}.{end}

{font3}Fwa hah hah!
{font0}You pathetic worms!{end}

I've no more use
for you.
Time to die!{end}

Who could possibly
have killed you!?{end}

Ughhh ... Arrghhh--
Gaaahhh--! ...{06}{07}
Are my dreams going ...
to end ... like this ...{06}{07}
Why!? Why was I bested ...
by worthless humans!{end}

Don't underestimate us!{end}

It's true that humans
can be foolish and weak!{06}{07}
But humans have hope, too!{06}{07}
We believe in ourselves
and value our friends.{06}{07}
Together, we can
stand up to any hardship.{end}

But being the friendless
and sadistic fiend you are,
you wouldn't understand.{end}

What drivel.
Unbelievable ...{06}{07}
This isn't over yet!{06}{07}
Alhazard, my Dark Blade,
unleash your power now!{end}

Wh, what ...?
I, I can't move ...{06}{07}
It's draining me ...
My magic ... is being
drained by the sword ...{06}{07}
Why, Alhazard!?{06}{07}
Alha ... za ...{end}

Obtained Alhazard.{end}

My goodness,
what happened here?{end}

B{3a}ser was weakened by
the unsealing ritual.{06}{07}
In his condition, he
couldn't withstand
Alhazard's tremendous will.{06}{07}
What an ironic death ...{end}

...{06}{07}
Alhazard destroys all
with lesser power.{end}

That's correct, Egbert!
Fools ..., all of them.{end}

Great, the darkness has lost
its influence. Now, we
can move on to unification!{end}

Alhazard and Langrisser ...{06}{07}
With these swords,
we can easily fulfil
the Kaiser's dream.{06}{07}
One ruler and one peace!{end}

We have trouble,
General Leon!{end}

This is bad,
Sir {02}!{end}

What is wrong, Laird?{end}

What is wrong, Laird?{end}

Liana and L{37}na together?{end}

I wasn't expecting
them to show up.{end}

Huh? Are you having
trouble with a seal again?{end}

What? Is the seal
giving us trouble again?{end}

In any case, we must
retrieve those two
as soon as possible!{end}

Understood!
We'll leave immediately!{end}

{font3}Hah hah hah.
Stupid humans!{06}{07}
{font3}How can you kill me
if I'm already dead?{end}

{font3}The oh so mighty
Empire graces us
with its presence.{end}

{font3}No ... I'm immortal--!{end}

{font3}I commend your
efforts in reaching here.{end}

{font3}Blood, need blood ...{end}

{font3}You dare fight me ...?
Do you not
know my strength?{end}

{font3}Ooohh--!{end}

{font3}Uugghh ...{end}

{font3}Argh--!{end}

{font3}Gaahh--!{end}

{font3}Ooohhh--!{end}

{font3}Gaahh!{end}

{font3}Hah hah hah!
This nightmare you
won't wake up from!{end}

{font3}My beauty will
last forever ...!{end}

{font3}I've come to
play, my pet!{end}

{font3}Aahhh ...{end}

{font3}For Master B{3a}ser!{end}

Die, traitors!{end}

{font3}Can't ... move ...{end}

{font3}Show me your
strength, humans ...!{end}

{font3}Kill the invaders!{end}

{font3}How disappointing ...{end}

Hmph ...
How foolish of me.
I fell for their trick ...{end}

The remaining
Descendants of Light, Sir.{06}{07}
The two shrine maidens
were captured on my watch.
I beg your forgiveness!{end}

That's a shame ...{06}{07}
Without those two,
we can't seal
the Dark Blade.{end}

Yes. After we unite the
continent, these weapons
will have no purpose.{06}{07}
We'll restore their seals
and let the legends fade ...{06}{07}
Our Kaiser does not
wish tragedies to repeat.{end}

Sonya ...
Could that be true ...?{06}{07}
But she was persecuted
for her demon blood.
Everything came from that!{end}

I'll tell you something else.{06}{07}
I knew humans would hate
Sonya for her heritage.
In fact, I counted on it.{06}{07}
Humans are so totally moronic,
they believed a half-demon
caused a plague ... 
that didn't even exist.{end}

That was all part of
your scheme, then!{06}{07}
I'll never forgive you!{end}

Yes, yes!
Anger! Hate!{06}{07}
Release your emotions and
fall to your inner darkness!{end}

Wow ...
Langrisser's power ...{06}{07}
With Alhazard,
my dark forces will rally!{end}

B{3a}ser, your life ends here!{end}

Alhazard's true purpose
will now be revealed!{end}
