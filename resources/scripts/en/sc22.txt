No!
Let go of me!{end}

Ha ha ha ...!{end}

Running won't help.
You can't escape.{end}

You shall release
the seal of Alhazard!{end}

...{end}

The ritual is nearly prepared.{06}{07}
You'd best do as I say, ...
or else.{end}

Whew!
Finally, land!
So this is Velzeria, hmm?{end}

Let's land the ship!{end}

Just as I expected ...{06}{07}
I figured you would
drop anchor here.{end}

Is that L{37}na!?{end}

{font3}Soon the ceremony
to awaken Alhazard
shall begin.{06}{07}
{font3}We can't let
them pass.{end}

I know that!{end}

Kill all those
who interfere.{end}

This has become so tiresome.{end}

But how does she have such
a command of the dark arts ...?{06}{07}
It's strange--
she's human just like us.{end}

Obviously.{06}{07}
She's Liana's twin sister
all right. Without Liana here,
I can't tell them apart.{end}

Perhaps Egbert isn't the
one controlling her ...{end}

Do your best not
to injure L{37}na.{06}{07}
This will be hard
enough for Lady Liana.{06}{07}
To have one's only
family as an enemy ...{end}

Hein, the battlefield's
an unpredictable place.
It's harsh and merciless.{06}{07}
We're trying to prevent
the revival of Alhazard.{06}{07}
If we lose sight of that,
we're at a disadvantage.{end}

Sir Lester ...,
I know how you feel.{06}{07}
But let's just try and do
what we can for her!{end}

Leave those two to me,
and go easy on L{37}na!{06}{07}
Our team's not going
to lose this one.{06}{07}
It might get ugly, but let's
detain that "Dark Princess!"{end}

Heh heh heh ...{06}{07}
Come and get me,
if you can.{end}

Obliterate the
Descendants of Light!{end}

{font3}Leave it to us.{06}{07}
{font3}We shall show the
puny humans our power.{end}

L{37}na's moving to
complete the ceremony.
Time's running out ...{end}

But where is the
ceremony taking place?{06}{07}
If we don't know,
we can't do anything.{end}

That's Jessica's job.{06}{07}
We need to concentrate
on breaking through.{end}

The ceremony is almost done.{06}{07}
Let's retreat!{end}

Weaklings, you
shall entertain me!{06}{07}
Finally, the age of
darkness has begun!{06}{07}
Gwa ha ha ha ...{end}

Ahh!
This feeling of dread ...{06}{07}
Alhazard's seal
has been broken!{end}

Wh, what does this mean!?{06}{07}
We couldn't stop the
Dark Blade's revival!{end}

Stop it, L{37}na.
B{3a}ser is already
dead, isn't he?{06}{07}
Why are you
following Egbert?{end}

Don't talk to me like
an old friend, trash.{06}{07}
The breaker of the seal,
Lord Egbert, and he who wields
Alhazard, Lord Bernhardt ...{06}{07}
They are very precious
people to us.{06}{07}
Ha ha ha ...
In fact, they've agreed
to release our god, Chaos ...{06}{07}
And Bernhardt has kindly
replaced B{3a}ser as master
of our demonic forces.{06}{07}
Descendants of Light,
here you meet your doom!{06}{07}
This is the last place
you will ever stand.{end}

{font3}Heh heh heh ...{06}{07}
{font3}Look, redheaded wimp!
I have something for you!{06}{07}
{font3}If only I could have
shown you that old
fool's bleeding corpse!{end}

Damn ...{end}

{font3}Gwa ha ha ha!{06}{07}
{font3}You despise me?
You want to kill me?{06}{07}
{font3}Hate and anguish
are my source of power!{06}{07}
{font3}Punk, let's see if you
still remember what
that old husk taught!{end}

{02},
don't give in to anger!{06}{07}
If you fight with rage
and pain in your heart, you'll
be no better than him!{end}

I know.
Thanks, Cherie ...
Doren said that too.{06}{07}
"No matter what
happens, you mustn't
lose sight of yourself ..."{end}

{02} ...{end}

I'm all right, Cherie.
Don't worry, okay?{06}{07}
If I lose my head, I'll have
no chance of winning.{end}

{font3}Hmmm ...
You must be the
leader, all right.{06}{07}
{font3}You don't seem as
stupid as the rest.{end}

What!
You won't be talking so
highly of yourself for long!{end}

Well, the only one left is
Faias. You're all alone.{06}{07}
I'll avenge Doren's death!{end}

Don't make me laugh!{06}{07}
You really think
you can beat me!?{end}

A fruit you've
never seen has fallen.{06}{07}

Will you eat it?{end}

MP raised by 4 points!{end}

Stand aside!
Get out of the way!{end}

{font3}Very good ...{06}{07}
{font3}But your luck is
about to run out!{end}

You underestimate me.{end}

Damn!
Just as we were arriving
in Velzeria ...{end}

Ugh! Sorry ...
I wish I could
keep fighting ...{end}

Let's go!{end}

Argh!
It doesn't ... hurt--!{end}

Damn!
I wasn't paying attention!{end}

Grrr!
In this important
time and place ... {06}{07}
Ow!
I'm retreating ...!{end}

You ...
Prepare to die!{end}

Son of a bitch!{end}

Oh ...
Alhazard's seal will be
broken, however ...{end}

I've been negligent
with my battle form ...{end}

You really should have been
stopped far earlier than this.{06}{07}
I guess we haven't taken
you seriously enough.{06}{07}
But, no matter.
This time we'll fight for real.{06}{07}
{font3}Go forth my servants!{end}

Impressive!
You possess such motivation.{06}{07}
Really, I would expect
nothing less from the
Descendants of Light.{06}{07}
How sad that I must finish you!{end}

Impossible ...
How could I lose to humans ...{end}

{font3}How dare a
mortal oppose me!{end}

{font3}Ahh, sleep peacefully
on my bosom ...{end}

{font3}Ugghh!{end}

{font3}Gahhh--!{end}

{font3}Arrrghhh!{end}

{font3}Noooo!{end}

{font3}Aaaahhh!{end}

{font3}G, gahhh!{end}

{font3}Gaahh--!{end}

{font3}Gahhh--!{end}

{font3}I have an old score
to settle with you,
Descendants of Light.{06}{07}
{font3}Especially the
redheaded one.{end}

What are you
talking about?{end}

{font3}You really
don't know?{06}{07}
{font3}B{3a}ser ordered me
to massacre the
Descendants of Light.{06}{07}
{font3}But while I was
searching you out,
an old fool
got in my way ...{end}

What!
That ..., that means
you killed Doren!?{end}

{font3}Heh heh ...
Oh yes, that was his
name I believe.{06}{07}
{font3}That bastard dealt
me a scratch that
aches even this day.{06}{07}
{font3}But he's dead, and soon
you'll go to join him.
Today, I will dance
in your blood!{end}

I'll never forgive you!
Prepare yourself!{end}

{font3}Come and get me!
Let's go, whelp!{end}

{font3}I won't fail B{3a}ser!{06}{07}
{font3}I'll wipe the 
Descendants' bloodline
from this world.{end}

I'll send you to hell!{end}

{font3}Heh heh heh ...
You flatter yourself!{06}{07}
{font3}A mere human can't
defeat those who
channel the
powers of darkness!{end}

{font3}Powerful indeed ...{06}{07}
{font3}But even with that
level of skill, opposing
Bernhardt is suicide!{06}{07}
{font3}A horrible death
awaits you in Velzeria ...{06}{07}
{font3}If Alhazard is revived,
summoning those with my
power is simple.{06}{07}
{font3}Though you've beaten
me, raising a sword to
Bernhardt is equal
to asking for death.{06}{07}
{font3}See you in hell!
Fwa ha ha ha ...
Gwa ha!{end}

Doren ...
I've avenged you.
Rest in peace, my master ...{end}

By my own hand,
I've avenged you ... {06}{07}
I hope you can finally
rest in peace, Doren ...{end}

{font3}Gwa ha ha ha...
Cry, little boy!{end}

He was slain because I was
a Descendant of Light ... {06}{07}
Doren gave his life in
exchange for mine ...{06}{07}
Everyone close to me dies ...
I can't protect anyone.{end}

{02} ...{end}

{02} ...
You were destined to be born
a Descendant of Light.{06}{07}
But the reason your allies
fight beside you isn't
because of your heritage.{06}{07}
It's because we
believe in you.{end}

Yeah, {02}!{end}

What brought you this
far wasn't just that ... {06}{07}
It's not just because you
are a Descendant of Light,
it's your personality and
the choices you've made.{end}

Yes ...
It's still not too late.{06}{07}
We'll combine all our
strength, prevent Alhazard's
revival, and protect this world!{end}

But we must stop
the ceremony!{end}

Let's hurry, {02}.{06}{07}
If Alhazard's power is
restored, it will be too
much for us to handle.{end}

Let's hurry.
The ceremony to unseal
Alhazard has begun.{06}{07}
Let's go to the
Temple of Darkness
and defeat Egbert!{end}

Impossible ...
Have my battalions have
been destroyed?{06}{07}
What terrible strength ...
Was this destruction wrought
by the Descendants of Light?{end}

{font3}Dark Princess!{06}{07}
{font3}Egbert has finished
the preparations.{06}{07}
{font3}Please return to the
Temple of Darkness.{end}

Yes, I understand.
Until Alhazard is reborn,
I cannot die ... {06}{07}
I will live to witness
the new age of darkness!{end}

Yes, I see.
Alhazard's rebirth is
very close now.{06}{07}
Finally, the age of
darkness is nigh!{end}

It seems the preparations for
the ceremony are underway.{end}

There's no time.
We must attack now!{06}{07}
We must stop the
ceremony and prevent 
Alhazard's awakening!{end}

{font3}You won't interfere
with the revival
of Alhazard.{06}{07}
{font3}To create our world of
darkness, we shall
protect Kaiser Bernhardt
and General Egbert!{end}

It can't be helped.
We must break
through their lines.{end}

{font3}Interesting ...{06}{07}
{font3}Then I'll share the
pain of this old wound
with you, boy!{end}

{font3}Arrggghhhh!{end}

{font3}Fwa ha ha.{06}{07}
We will burn the
Descendants of Light
to ashes!{end}

{font3}Ooohhhhh--!{end}

I'm sorry for being late.{06}{07}
I found the Temple of Darkness,
but I was forced to take
the long route on my return.{end}

You found it?{end}

Yes.
It's lies shortly
north of here.{06}{07}
The awakening ritual
is already underway.{end}

Jessica!
It seems that their
ritual has begun!{06}{07}
L{37}na has gone to the
Temple of Darkness.{end}

Jessica!
It seems the preparations
for the ceremony are over.{06}{07}
L{37}na has apparently gone
to the Temple of Darkness ...{end}

{02}, let's hurry!
We must stop
Alhazard's revival!{end}
