What!?
You still haven't finished yet?{end}

If we don't cut the lines
in time, General Imelda will
have my head ...{end}

Hurry up!{06}{07}
If we take out the bridge,
it will halt their advance.{06}{07}
Cut the lines before
they can get across!{end}

Oh no ...!
Imperial soldiers!{end}

Curses!
You're earlier than I thought!{06}{07}
I, Kr{38}mer of the
Water Dragon Navy, shall
let you proceed no further!{end}

The Imperial forces have
made it this far ahead ...
Impressive ...{end}

They've already fortified
the border ...{06}{07}
I'm sorry our Kalxathian forces
weren't able to stop them ...{end}

It's all right, Keith.
It can't be helped.{06}{07}
The last battle was
proof Kalxath alone isn't
strong enough ...
Besides, we're out of time.{06}{07}
I'm worried about the
stronghold up ahead.{06}{07}
Let's hurry.
We have to get past them!{end}

{02}!
Let's break through
their advance guard!{end}

Yeah,
the Empire is probably after
Langrisser as we speak.{end}

All right!
Let's go, everyone!{end}

The enemy has flying units ...
We should be careful.{06}{07}
They move quickly and
could surround us.{end}

That's right.{06}{07}
But they can be easily
defeated by Elves.{06}{07}
Flying troops are very
weak to bow attacks.{end}

Is that so?
You know so much, Hein!{end}

Huh?{06}{07}
Cherie, you didn't know
that about flying units?{end}

I, I knew that!
I just ...
Oh shut up, Hein!{end}

Princess, you can't survive
without such basic knowledge.{06}{07}
I've been telling you
to study your tactics.{end}

It's so boring to study.
The best way to learn is
through real battle.{end}

So, you didn't
know that, after all.{end}

S, shut up!{end}

Lure them all into
the middle of the
bridge and attack!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

You still haven't
taken down the bridge?{end}

No, not yet.{end}

Well, hurry it up!
We can't let them
take another step!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Hmmm,
why is the bridge
still standing!?{end}

It's sturdier than
than we thought.{end}

Hurry, hurry!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Lord Kr{38}mer,
we're almost done.{end}

Do it quicker!
The enemy is stronger
than I anticipated.{end}

It won't be much longer!
The bridge is almost dismantled!{end}

All right, hurry up!{end}

Everyone, hurry!
We're almost at the
end of the bridge!{end}

Watch out for those
airborne units ...{06}{07}
This is where manoeuvrability
will work most in their favour.
We've got to stop their leader.{end}

Let's hurry!
There's only one rope left.{end}

Everyone! Hurry!
There's only one rope left.{end}

This is our last chance
to break through!{06}{07}
Everyone, charge!{end}

This will be the decisive blow!
Concentrate all attacks
on their commanders!{end}

Haven't you finished yet!?{end}

Yes, Sir!
Preparations are complete!
We're ready to drop the bridge!{end}

All right then, proceed!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Ha ha ha!
This will stop them for good!
Glory to the Empire!{end}

You know, it's pretty daring
of the Imperials to form an
army solely of flying units.{end}

Even in closed ranks, they can
freely adapt their formation to
the situation at hand ...{06}{07}
It shows they really have an
advanced knowledge of tactics.{end}

Damn!
They've made it this far ...{06}{07}
Engineers, what are you doing!?
The bridge is still up!
If you don't hurry,
they'll get across!{end}

How odd ... There's an
entrance to a cave here.{06}{07}
Let's leave it for now.
We can check it out later.{end}

You notice a small sapling
within a group of four trees.{06}{07}

Hidden beneath the sapling
you spot a little sprite ...{06}{07}

What will you do to it?{end}

Smile at it{end}

Scare it{end}

Don't say anything{end}

"You're a funny guy.
I'll give you some power!"{end}

MDF raised!{end}

"I don't like you!"{06}{07}

The sprite disappears.{end}

Without saying anything,
the sprite disappears.{end}

Let's go!{end}

Gahh ...
Is this it ...?{end}

All right!
Let's go!{end}

Oh, ...
I have been ... defeated ...{end}

Don't get in my way!{end}

I, I can't go on any more ...{end}

Sorry, everyone ...{end}

We can't let the Imperials
just walk all over us!{end}

Argh ...
Such dishonour ...{end}

Hey, there!
Prepare for my onslaught!{end}

Sorry!
Please fight on in my name ...{end}

Okay, ... now!
All squads, commence attack!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Just a bit more ...
Just a little more time
and they'll be ours!{06}{07}
I can do it by myself
if I have to!{end}

Just a bit more ...
Just a little more time
and they'll be ours!{06}{07}
We must not lose.
Everyone, back me up!{end}

Ugh ...
The operation failed ...{06}{07}
I must report to
General Imelda ...
All troops, retreat!{end}

Ugh ...
The operation failed ...{06}{07}
I must report to
General Imelda ...
All troops, retreat!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

We've wasted a lot of time.{end}

{02}!
Let's hurry!{06}{07}
There must be a reason
those Imperials were trying
to drop the bridge.{end}

We certainly must hurry.
The Empire is after Langrisser.{end}

Let's get to the
stronghold, quickly!{end}

They may have already
laid siege to the stronghold ...{end}

Yeah, ...
but don't worry.
My battle instructor is there.{end}

Oh, really?{06}{07}
Well then, we can rely on him,
if he's the one who made you
the beastly, tough
swordswoman you are now.{end}

Hein ...!
You ...{06}{07}
You insensitive bastard!
How could you call a
cute girl like me "tough"
and "beastly?"{end}

Right, {02}?{end}

Well ...{end}

No, those are the
right words!{06}{07}
You're cute, Cherie, but
you're also a tough girl!{end}

...
That's enough, let's hurry.{end}

Hmmm, I just remembered,
I saw a cave by the cliff.
What should we do ...?{end}

Will you examine
the cliff opening?{end}

Let's have a look.
I feel uneasy
leaving it unchecked.{end}

We really don't have
time to look into it.{end}

I know, but there might be
something there to help in our
battle against the Empire.{end}

Well, {02}, if you
say so, I guess it's all right.{end}

All right, everyone!
Let's check the cave.{end}

We'd better just hurry on.{end}

All right!
Let's go, everyone.{end}

I'll show you the power
of the Imperial Army!{end}

Gahh--!{end}

L, Lord Kr{38}mer ...{end}

Feel the power of the
Water Dragon Navy!{end}

Gah ...
I can't hang on any more ...{end}

Argh ...
What a horrible night
to have a curse--!{end}

Ha ha, die!{end}

Ugh ...
Too strong ...{end}

Long live the Kaiser!{end}

Ugh!
This is it ...{end}

Argh!
I'm finished ...{end}

Ahh!
Blood ...
My blood ...{end}

Impossible!
How could I ...{end}

Ugh ...
The troops General Imelda
entrusted to me ...{06}{07}
Well, even if I'm
the last one standing,
I won't let you pass!{end}

Shriek!
It's frightening, but
I have to persevere ...{end}

N, not bad, huh!{end}

Clearly, their goal was to
stay our advance.
I fear for the stronghold.{06}{07}
Worse yet, ... this likely gave
them time to find Baldea, too.{end}

You'll go no further!{end}
