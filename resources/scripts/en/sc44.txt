Fucking hell!
How can that bastard
be of holy lineage!?{end}

Lester, don't
badmouth {02}
so harshly.{06}{07}
{02} decided that
the best way to bring peace
is through Imperial rule.
His goal is still peace ...{end}

Lester has every right to be
angry, but we shouldn't waste
time slandering {02}.{06}{07}
We must think of a plan to
prevent {02} and the
Imperial Guard from getting
their hands on the Holy Sword.{end}

Keith is right! We don't know
what may happen if the Empire
holds both legendary blades!{06}{07}
Besides, its my duty as a
Descendant of Light to protect
Langrisser from being used for
greed and power!{end}

Yeah, yeah.
I know already!
You don't have to yell.{end}

This turn of events is quite
a dilemma. I had such high
hopes for young {02} ...{06}{07}
We must formulate a
plan to prevent the Empire
from reaching Baldea.{end}

What about the Sky Bridge
over the Railem Ravine?{06}{07}
It's the main route.
If we take out the bridge, the
Empire would have to detour.{06}{07}
That should give us a
significant time advantage in
beating them to Baldea and
finding Langrisser.{end}

Keith, ... you don't mean ...{end}

Can you think of another way?
It's our best option
and this is serious business.{06}{07}
The Princess and I must
rally our divided forces around
the nation. We need a volunteer
for this important mission ...{end}

Lester, where
are you going?{end}

Leave this to me Keith.  If
you can't do it, aren't I the
only one left fit for the job?{end}

B, but ...{end}

Don't sweat it.
After all, what are friends for?{end}

Lester ...
Thank you.{end}

Hey, is the bridge
ready to be blown yet?{end}

Well, the bridge is better
constructed than we originally
guessed, but we're working.{end}

Well speed it up, if we don't
finish soon, those Imperial
jackasses will show up!{end}

Leon, how much further
until we reach Castle Baldea?{end}

Hmmm ... Regrettably,
we don't know
its exact location.{06}{07}
However, the ancient
records we've acquired
strongly indicate it lies
beyond this valley.{end}

Ha ha ... So we're
on a wild goose chase
as far as you know.{06}{07}
I suppose you have Colonel
Laird and some advance scouts
finding out the specifics?{end}

Exactly.
Our first priority seems to be
crossing this bridge, though.{end}

Sir Lester,
the Imperial Army!{end}

Son of a bitch! We need more
time ... Workers, hurry the hell
up, we don't have all day!{end}

{02}, they look
like they're trying to cut
down the bridge!{end}

If they succeed, we
won't reach Baldea
before Jessica's group!{end}

We still have time! We must
beat Jessica's group to Baldea
and obtain Langrisser first!{end}

Heh, with a force that small
we'll be able to slice
through them with ease.{06}{07}
Hell, they'll probably
scatter before the bridge
collapses anyway.{end}

Okay, let's break through!
Keep your guard up, they could
be planning something.{end}

It looks like they still
plan to advance!
Prepare to intercept!{end}

Just leave it
to us, boss.{end}

And don't let up on the bridge!
Don't be distracted by
the fight--just keep working.{end}

Understood, Sir.{end}

If we don't make it in time,
we'll lose our chance at
beating Jessica's group!{06}{07}
It might be asking a bit
much, but give me your all!
We must win!{end}

Don't be impatient, 
we're going our fastest.{end}

We're going, we're going!
Come on everyone, hurry!{end}

Workers!
What's the news
on the bridge!?{end}

I'm very sorry, Sir!
It will only be
just a little bit longer!{end}

I see ...  Well, we have
to do something before
we're cut down here!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

We'll stop their advance here!
Continue the operation, Lester!{end}

Keith, you're a life saver!
Go kick some ass for me, too!{end}

Guys, what the
hell is taking so long!?{end}

Just a little longer!
The supporting ropes
have all been severed!{06}{07}
The only things left
are the main ropes!{end}

Come on, get the
lead out and
drop it already!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Isn't it about time
to get out of here?{end}

Right now, we're in
the middle of severing
the main ropes.{06}{07}
If we cut two more,
then the bridge is sure to fall!
We beg your patience!{end}

Troops, get off the bridge!
At this rate, you'll fall, too!{end}

Our aerial squadron will keep
the enemy busy while your
troops withdraw, Lester!{end}

It seems you boys
are in a bit of trouble.
Need a hand?{end}

General Imelda of the Imperial
Water Dragon Navy
has come to lend us a hand?{end}

Wow ...{end}

What, haven't you ever
seen a grown woman before?
Don't be so shy.{end}

The chick General of the Water
Dragon Navy? God damn it--!{06}{07}
Reinforcements at a
time like this are the last
thing we need.{end}

All right boys, its time
you learnt a little lesson!{end}

Well then, let's get
back to work.
Everyone, do your best!{end}

So, you're that redheaded
upstart who gave
Leon so much trouble ...{06}{07}
Let's see what you're
made of, little man.
Give me some orders!{end}

Imelda joins the entourage!{end}

Mission accomplished!
The bridge has been cut down!{end}

Ha ha ha!
Eat it, shit wads!
See you next fall, {02}!{end}

Damn!{06}{07}
Everyone withdraw!
The bridge is going to fall!{end}

Sir Lester, accept my apologies
for putting a sea veteran
like yourself up to this.{06}{07}
I came as soon as
possible to assist you, but ...{end}

Its no big deal, Keith!
Besides, we're
pals, aren't we?{06}{07}
Plus, seeing the Kalxath
Aerial Knights in full action
over this terrain is awesome.{end}

In the forest, you find a wooden
platform boxed in by trees.{06}{07}

There appears to be a
small sprite sitting nearby.{06}{07}

What will you do to it?{end}

Try to make it laugh.{end}

Scare it away{end}

Don't say anything{end}

Hey, you're a funny guy.
I'll help you out!{end}

Magic Resistance raised!{end}

You're the kind
of people we hate!{06}{07}

Leave us sprites alone!{end}

Since you didn't call
out to the sprite, it left.{end}

Hmm? There's an entrance
to somewhere here ...{06}{07}
But, we can't worry
about that now!
We'll explore it later.{end}

Keith, get out
of the way!{end}

I'm afraid I cannot
comply with your command.{06}{07}
Otherwise, you gentlemen
might obtain Langrisser.{06}{07}
This is our, the people of
Kalxath's, duty.  In the 
beginning, I fought with you
to protect Langrisser, but ...{06}{07}
The princess is also saddened
by this turn of events ...
We have no
choice but to battle.{end}

If that's the only
way, then so be it!{end}

Make way!{end}

Ugh! It's over for me ...{end}

Take that!{end}

Sorry ...
I've been ... slain--!{end}

If you wish to die,
then come at me!{end}

Ugh! I've failed!{end}

Don't get in my way!{end}

For me to have fallen ...,
it seems as if I bit off more
than I could chew.{end}

All right, come on!{end}

Ah, what an incredible man.{06}{07}
If you are able to beat me,
maybe we can get to know
each other a little better ...{end}

Quit fuckin'
with me, bitch!{end}

Die!{end}

Ugh, oh no!
Did I screw up!?{end}

You're revolting to behold!
Disappear into nothingness!{end}

Argh! I think I went a little
overboard, probably.{06}{07}
Take care of the rest!{end}

Well, aren't you
being smart?{end}

Looks like I have to fill
in for Keith now, too ...{end}

If you continue this,
you won't have any hope of
victory, you know!{06}{07}
Why not relent
and let us pass?{end}

Fat chance.
I'm staying until the
bridge falls!{end}

Hey! Who said you could
cross without paying the toll?
This troll is coming to collect!{end}

{02}, I never
would have thought in a
million years ...{06}{07}
You would team
up with the Empire ...{end}

People can be easily
separated by their ideals ...{end}

Well, that's life!
Every person walks his own
path, after all. Now, fight!{end}

What the hell is
keeping you guys!?{end}

Just a little longer!
Just wait a little bit longer!{end}

Get the lead out, guys ...
At this rate,
we aren't going make it.{end}

Master Lester!{end}

Sorry about this, man!
it's all my fault ...{06}{07}
I failed in the mission to stop
them from crossing the bridge!
Guys, let's pull out!{end}

Ugh ... Shit!
Just as I thought ... I couldn't
pull it off by myself.{06}{07}
Workers!
The plan's a bust!
Let's get amscray!{end}

Argh, well done, 
{02} ...{06}{07}
You won't have it this
easy next time, though ...
Let's retreat, guys!{end}

Lester ...{end}

Hmmm, ... indeed.
You've lived up to my
expectations, {02}!{06}{07}
From now on, let's work hard
for the glory of our Empire!{end}

That means a lot to me, Leon.
However, just exactly
what am I fighting for ...?{end}

To end all wars{end}

To obtain power{end}

I don't know yet ...{end}

That's right.{06}{07}
The way to end the war is to
unite the continent, just like
the Empire is doing.{end}

To end the wars, {02}
is going to lend his strength to
the Rayguard Empire!{end}

All right, let's get moving.
We need to obtain
Langrisser quickly.{end}

That's right.{06}{07}
If one possesses tremendous
power, one can end wars 
quickly by crushing opponents.{06}{07}
Once stopped, other countries
would capitulate on our
terms, and war would cease
out of fear of retribution!{06}{07}
It's only natural I take up
arms with the Empire
in a situation like this.{end}

Indeed, the
Empire is mighty.{06}{07}
And foolish are the
weak who would bear arms
against the mighty.{end}

I don't know.{06}{07}
Why did I turn against my
friends for my selfish reasons?
Am I dedicated to the Empire,
or to myself ...?{end}

Well, if the Empire succeeds
in this war, they would unite
the continent under one ruler.{06}{07}
With only one ruler, there
would be no state to
bear arms against another.{06}{07}
Is it not peace and the
end of war on El Sallia's
soil your goal?{end}

If the Kaiser rules the
continent, no one would oppose
him! War would end.{end}

That was fast.
You didn't leave
any for me ...{end}

General Imelda of
the Water Dragon Navy,
I presume ...{end}

Hmm? What the ...{end}

You're {02}, aren't you?
I've heard about you.{06}{07}
I'm Imelda of the
Water Dragon Navy.{06}{07}
I came here to help you
out a bit, but it seems as
though I wasn't needed.{end}

That's not true. 
The more allies we obtain, the
stronger we'll become.{06}{07}
Please, join us!{end}

All right, little boy.
Don't get so
excited over me.{end}

Imelda joins the entourage!{end}

Oh, before I forget!
I found a weird opening before,
but what should I do about it?{end}

Do you want to
investigate it further?{end}

The truth is, I found a
weird entrance while we were
in the midst of fighting.{06}{07}
There may be something
in there that will aid
the Empire. Let's go in!{end}

Nah.{06}{07}
We really need to find
Langrisser. I think it's best
if I just forget about it.{end}

If you're going to
come, hurry up!{end}

I wanted to ...
protect ... Les ... te--{end}

We are off to
intercept the enemy.{end}

Don't be on the bridge
when it collapses!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

You shall not pass!{06}{07}
If you intend to, you must
defeat me in battle, first!{end}

Sir Lester,
please take care
of the rest ...{end}

Damn guys ...
Don't just throw away
your lives.{end}

We must protect
Sir Lester!{end}

I won't hand Langrisser
over to you!{end}

H, hurry ...
Hurry, drop the ...{end}

Even if it means I lose my life,
I shall not let you through!{06}{07}
Attack!{end}

We cannot withdraw from here!{end}

Attack!{end}

Gaahh!{end}

Inform every aerial squad!{06}{07}
Flank the imperial
troops on the bridge
and attack! Go!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Gotcha!{end}

Witness the might of the
Kalxath Aerial Knights!{end}

I didn't wish to fight you
as an enemy ...
However, such is war.{end}

Ugh--!
Forgive me, Master Lester.
It seems I was of no help ...{end}

Keith!{06}{07}
Are you all right!?
Buying us this much time
was more than enough!{06}{07}
Don't be stupid,
just get out of here!{end}

Forgive me ...,
my friend.{06}{07}
I'll return the favour
someday, I promise!{end}

Hurry up!
Follow Sir Keith!{end}

I won't let you
cross this valley!{end}

Im, impossible ...{end}

You're pretty good,
aren't you?{end}

I ...{end}

I can't let you
go any further!{end}

The Empire's troops ...
are ... well ... trained.{end}

You're strong,
too strong ...!{end}

Ugh, strong ...{end}

Don't be rash!
Those guys
are very powerful!{end}

I can't believe this ...
I'm the only one left ...{06}{07}
However, I won't give
up so fast! I'm seeing this
through to the end!{end}

Aye, sir!
We'll aid you
with all our strength!{end}

Please!{end}

All right, {02}.
Come on!{end}

Damn it!
Our assault troops
have been fucked.{06}{07}
The only people left to
handle this are us.
These guys are too much.{end}

Exactly, {02}.{06}{07}
In order to accomplish
that, we must first quickly
obtain Langrisser.{end}

And if we
have Langrisser ...{end}

Exactly ...{06}{07}
If we allow Langrisser
to fall into the hands of
our enemies, this war
will last indefinitely.{end}

In order to stop the enemy
in their tracks, we
need to give it our all!{end}

So far, this is the
proper course of action ...{end}

What?
Reinforcements?{end}

Master Lester!
Has the bridge been
brought down yet?{end}

Sorry, bud ...{06}{07}
Before we could
finish, someone stuck
their noses in.{end}

We'll take care of them.
In the meantime, please
bring down the bridge.{end}

Leave it to us, Keith!{end}

Go for it!{end}

Don't worry about the pixie
loving insects in the air.{06}{07}
I brought a detachment of
High Elves with me. They'll
snipe those pigeon riders
right out of the sky!{end}

Damn ...!
It would be wise to not get
too close to that woman!{end}

All right!
Let's go, everyone!{06}{07}
For the sake of claiming the
legendary holy blade!{end}
