Langrisser ...
This will be your last errand ...{end}

Langrisser ...
Seal the power of Alhazard.{end}

The clouds are finally parting.{end}

Alhazard's evil aura
is no more.{end}

About time ... maybe
now there can finally be
peace in El Sallia.{end}

That's right!
With Alhazard gone, we've
beaten evil!{end}

No ...
It's never that simple ...{06}{07}
Though Alhazard's power
may be sealed off, that doesn't
mean war has ended.{end}

Indeed, {02}.
The Rayguard Empire has been
reduced to shambles.{06}{07}
The fractured states will
begin a new war of unification.
Such is the way of history.{end}

That's why ...
I must continue my journey.{06}{07}
A journey to realise an
ideal world, where people
can finally know peace.{end}

You are right ...
Until that day, our battle
shall never end.{end}

I'll return to Salrath
to help my father.{06}{07}
We will work hard to help
create an ideal world.{end}

I'll help too!{06}{07}
With Kalxath and its
neighbouring nations working
together, I'm sure we can bring
peace to the land.{end}

Now you're finally talking
like a princess. Perhaps I can
finally retire to quieter life.{end}

Well since Cherie has such a
crush on me, I'll have to go
wherever she does! Hee hee.{end}

Why you ...! Hein, you're mean!
Keith! This is all because of
you and your big mouth!{end}

If everyone combines his or
her strength, one day,
we can make peace happen.{end}

I pray you are right ...
Well then, everyone, onward!
Let's bring peace to this age!{end}

Is something troubling
you, Jessica?{end}

No ...
It's nothing, Lushiris.{end}

Thanks to {02} and his
companions, Alhazard and its
evil power have disappeared.{06}{07}
However, at the same time,
Langrisser has also vanished ...{end}

Lushiris, I don't understand
what you mean.{end}

Sieghart's spirit ...
His is the soul of Langrisser.{06}{07}
With the evil powers of
Alhazard sealed off, his soul
felt its task had finally ended.{end}

Exactly, Jessica.{end}

That voice is ... Sieghart's!{end}

The sword and I have
changed much over the last
several hundred years ...{06}{07}
The world has been shaped both
for us and because of us.{end}

Yes ...{06}{07}
In this war, the humans
worried about their future
and took action to make
their dreams come true.{end}

Just as children separate
from parents, so humans now
separate from their god ...{06}{07}
Jessica, thank you for
your service thus far.
From now on, I would have
you live your own life.{end}

Thank you, my mission
has finally ended. Mankind
has need of me no more.{06}{07}
But perhaps for a little
longer, I'll stand watch over
this new world ...{end}

Sieghart, come ...
Let us watch together the
dawn of this new age.{end}
