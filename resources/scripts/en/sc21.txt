I wonder how
everyone is doing ...?{end}

{02} ...{end}

Something ...!?{end}

Intruders!{end}

Ahh!{end}

The Empire's magicians?{06}{07}

We shall not allow you
into the inner sanctum!{end}

You won't get any further!{06}{07}

Ugh ...!{06}{07}

Argh!{end}

Liana, isn't it?{end}

And where do you think
you are going, little girl?{06}{07}
Were you thinking of trying
to escape from me?{end}

No! Let go!{06}{07}
Help me, {02}!{end}

You'll be coming with us.{end}

Ahh!{end}

Good ...
Our mission was a success.{06}{07}
Let us withdraw.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Why is this taking so long?
Are the preparations
almost complete?{end}

No, not yet.
Please, be a little
more patient!{end}

Hurry up!{06}{07}
We have to set sail soon--
our enemy's right behind us.{end}

Oh no!
The Imperial Army's warship!{end}

How fortunate!
We'll take their sails and
head for Velzeria!{end}

Shit!
The enemy has
caught up to us.{end}

How much longer will the
preparations take?{end}

Umm ... 
We still need more time.{06}{07}
There are so many supplies
to load, and we don't
have that many soldiers ...{end}

Such inefficiency!{06}{07}
Get to work scum!
Don't waste time with your
worthless excuses!{end}

Sigh ...{06}{07}
I guess it can't
be helped then.{06}{07}
No matter what, we've got
to buy some more time.{end}

Yes, my Lady.
I understand.{06}{07}
We will hold them back, even
if it costs us our lives!{end}

Let's hurry, {02}.{06}{07}
Even if we succeed in
taking their ship, it's still
going to be a long
voyage to Velzeria.{end}

You're right.{06}{07}
Even with a boat like that, the
Direth Straits will be a struggle
to cross this time of year ...{end}

The departure preparations
look like they're going slow.{06}{07}
Let's commandeer the ship
while we have a chance!{end}

How are the preparations?
How close are you?{end}

We've just finished loading
our weapon stocks.{end}

That's it!?
Hurry with the rest!{end}

Hurry up with the rest.{06}{07}
How goes the battle
for our garrison?{end}

Still not done yet?{end}

Almost everything
is in the hold now.{06}{07}
Give us a little more
time, and we're done!{end}

You screw around,
and I'll leave you here!{end}

Aye, aye!{06}{07}
Come on lads!
Give it all you've got!{end}

Tell me about the battle.
Report, now!{end}

You're still not done!?{06}{07}
How ... 
You must be the world's
most incompetent crew!{end}

There's no time!{end}

There's no time!{06}{07}
Put your backs into it!
For God sakes, hurry!{end}

There's no time!{06}{07}
Work as though your life
depends on it--
because it does.{end}

Ho ho ho!{06}{07}
It seems we've made it.
Bye bye, little man!{end}

Shit!
We're too late ...{end}

It can't be helped ...{06}{07}
So, loading all this baggage
is going to take a while?{end}

We're working on it.{06}{07}
There's still a good deal
to move aboard.{end}

If they board, I'll have to
thank that scruffy peasant boy
for our last encounter!{end}

O, Of course, General!{end}

I don't get it ...
Is she kind to anyone
besides herself?{end}

Hein, you worry about
the strangest things.{end}

But that general of theirs
seems to hate everyone.{06}{07}
She rails on her own men,
and even the dock workers--
those people are working
hard to save her.{end}

At least the
Blue Dragon Knights
battle with honour.{06}{07}
Imelda and Leon
are two of the Empire's
four generals ...{06}{07}
Yet their behaviour
is leagues apart.
They treat their men
so differently ...{end}

Son of a--!{06}{07}
You think you can take
this boat from me?{06}{07}
It's not going to happen.
Too bad for you.{end}

You imbeciles!
Really, how can I
put up with you!{06}{07}
The enemy is marching
right in front of us!
Get moving!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

I'm sorry, General.{end}

There is an old
wooden box here.{06}{07}

Will you open it?{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{end}

Oh ...!
How can I die here ...{end}

Come now.
There's no need to hurry.{06}{07}
Opposing me, as always,
was a deadly mistake.
Ho ho ho ...{end}

No ...{end}

Ouch--!
Hey, what are you doing!{end}

Ugh, my old wound is ...{end}

Damn, not bad!
But I should expect as much
from the Water Dragon Navy.{end}

How reckless ...
If you manage to get the
ship, let me know!{end}

I'll have to practice more.{end}

I can't lose!{end}

Ugh ...{06}{07}
They really ...
live up to their reputation ...{end}

Ha Ha Ha--!
Die! All of you, die!{end}

Eeek!
W, why ...{end}

Im, Imelda ...{end}

Here I come!
I'm going to
pulverise you!{end}

Impertinent fools!{end}

Gah ...!
I'm being called away ...{end}

Come on, bring it!{end}

General ...
Imelda ...{end}

Prepare to depart.
Ready the mast!{end}

This is bad.{06}{07}
Hurry, now!{end}

Cut the mooring lines,
and raise the anchor!{end}

There's no time.
We must win at once!{end}

You should be thankful
to die by my hand!{end}

Son of a--!
No one should dare
raise arms against me!{end}

Gah!{06}{07}
So ... so beautiful ...{06}{07}
I'm ... in a far ...
off place ...{06}{07}
It's too dark ...{end}

All right,
time to set sail!{06}{07}
Next stop, Velzeria!{end}

Raise the anchor!
Let's catch some wind.{end}

Raise the anchor.
All aboard!{end}

Until we leave port,
I'll command the ship!{end}

Ugh ...
I can't fight like this ...{end}

General Imelda!{06}{07}
Gah--!{end}

Well, let's go!{06}{07}
We can't let the enemy
capture this ship!{06}{07}
Let's buy General Imelda
some time!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

As we expected.
It seems General Leon assesses
his enemies quite well.{end}

Laird ...,
thanks a lot.{06}{07}
Next time, leave it to me.{06}{07}
Please fall back.{06}{07}
If I let you die,
I'll never be able to
face Leon again.{end}

I was of no help ...{06}{07}
How regrettable ...{end}

That's not true.{06}{07}
You bought us some
more time to escape.{06}{07}
Godspeed, Colonel ...{end}

Yes ...{end}

Please ...
Please give Leon
my regards.{end}

This is totally pathetic!{06}{07}
You're an embarrassment
to your Navy.{06}{07}
Don't you take pride
in being a soldier in the
Water Dragon Navy?{06}{07}
If you think you're weak,
then you should work on a
concentrated attack!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

I'm sorry!{end}

Damn it!
My division's
falling apart.{06}{07}
What useless fools!
I'll just have to 
do this by myself!{end}

General Imelda ...{06}{07}
I'm sorry, but it looks
like everyone is
going to die ...{end}

Don't slack off!{06}{07}
If you die, do it
delaying our enemy!{end}

Yes!
Even if it takes my life!{end}

Imelda!
Th, the troops have
been annihilated!{end}

Impossible ...
We can't wait any longer.{06}{07}
Proceed with the departure!{end}

Yes!
At once!{end}

Yes!
Whatever you say!{end}

I've said it before, but we
don't have enough soldiers
for reinforcements.{06}{07}
You were trained to die
for your General.
And make no mistake--
today, die you shall!{end}

Okay ...
In that case,
continue delaying them!{end}

Yes!
Everyone, fight bravely!{end}

All right!
For our General,
we must hold the line!{end}

Understood!{end}

Wait, {02}!
You won't get away
with this!{end}

Laird is here!
Of all the times!{end}

Isn't that Laird!?{06}{07}
You've come to help us?{06}{07}
I'll have to thank
you later!{end}

Hmph.{06}{07}
We're here because
our General is operating
independently on a
covert mission.{06}{07}
Though our ranks have thinned,
please allow us to assist you.{end}

Leon must have
been worried to have
deployed you here.{06}{07}
Anyway, until the boat
leaves, please help us
impede the enemy!{end}

Certainly, General Imelda.{06}{07}
{02}, you won't be
going anywhere today.{06}{07}
Knights, strike
for General Leon!{end}
