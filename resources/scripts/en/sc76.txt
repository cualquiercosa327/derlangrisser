Everyone, status report.{end}

We are ordained to seal
the ruins' power without
damaging that within.{06}{07}
We need to do this right,
so be patient.{end}

I wish we could just break
this place apart.
We'd be done in a flash.{end}

This place is our only
means of contacting Lushiris.{06}{07}
If it were destroyed, we
couldn't speak with her,
and that would be very bad.{end}

I'm a little worried
about Jessica ...{end}

Lester, it seems meeting
Jessica really changed you ...{06}{07}
How did you two meet?
Do you want to talk about it?{end}

...{06}{07}
As a kid, I sailed
the seas with my father.
He was a pirate.{06}{07}
Like usual, we were
trying to "take back"
treasure from a bunch of
thieves, like mercs.{06}{07}
At one point, my father's
shipmates fell to a rival crew,
and our boat sank.{06}{07}
I was only nine years old.
I couldn't do a fucking thing
but wait for them to kill me ...{06}{07}
The one who saved
me was Jessica
in her former life.{end}

So that's what happened ...{end}

Jessica raised me.
That's how I met Egbert,
whom she cared for.{end}

...?{06}{07}
Shouldn't Egbert be
around your age, then?{end}

He's slightly older than me.{06}{07}
His obsession with
forbidden left a mark or
two on that asshole's
body, wouldn't ya say?{end}

Hmmm ...{end}

Before long, we all grew up.{06}{07}
Jessica started to talk
about using her magic to
return as a newborn.{06}{07}
We were kids back then.
It ended up being a
pretty crazy mess of things.{06}{07}
Egbert upped and left us
just as soon as she came back.{06}{07}
The next time we met,
he was under the flag of
Bernhardt and Rayguard.{end}

So, Jessica's about twenty ...
How about you, Lester?{06}{07}
If you were nine ..., 
that means you're thirty!?
Wow, I'd have never guessed!{end}

...!?{end}

Well, enough about that.
They're coming!{end}

Well well, this looks
to be quite enjoyable!{end}

So, you've
finally found us.{end}

Hmmm ... this place ...
Where are we?{end}

This is ...!
This is the gate that bridges
our world and Heaven!{06}{07}
B{3a}ser told me about it.
Through here, we can go to
the home of the gods!{end}

Whatever it is, it looks
like they they're
trying to dismantle it ...{end}

Liana and Jessica
aren't around either.{end}

Perhaps they've
used this gate and are
searching for Lushiris.{06}{07}
No ... We can't allow that.
They're probably
trying to seal Langrisser!{end}

That would put
us in quite a fix.{06}{07}
Let's follow them through
and hunt em' down.{end}

Going through the gate
means going through us.{end}

Get out of the way.{end}

Cherie, seal the gate!
I'll keep them off you.{end}

I know, I know!
Don't overdo it, Lester.{end}

Retain defensive positions!
Keep them from the gate!{end}

They've breached the entrance.
Work as fast as you can!{end}

Understood!{end}

Faster, faster!
We're almost done!{end}

Move quickly.
They're getting desperate.{end}

It's all right ...
I can bear this ...{end}

Do your best!
Just a little longer!{end}

Yes, we did it!
Jessica is safe!{end}

Oh yeah, everyone!
We've sealed these ruins!{end}

Cherie, Lester, we've
done what you've asked!
Feel free to celebrate!{end}

Langrisser's radiance is ...
It's dimming! Damn!{06}{07}
We wasted too much time!
Langrisser's power
will soon be no more ...{end}

Are they trying
to close the gate?{end}

If we can't get to Lushiris,
she'll sap Langrisser's power.
It will become a simple sword.{end}

What shall we do?
Tell me!{end}

We must restore the original
positions of the magic
lithographs on that altar.{06}{07}
If we can do that, these ruins
should start working again.{end}

Ah hah!
Then let's make haste.{end}

I set the displaced magic
lithograph on the left
and restored its functionality.{end}

I set the displaced magic
lithograph in the centre
and restored its functionality.{end}

I set the displaced magic
lithograph on the right
and restored its functionality.{end}

Has it been breached!?
Guys, they're coming after us!{end}

They're coming!
Be careful!{end}

Let us pass, Lester!{end}

Why yes, pardon me.
You can go right ahead.{06}{07}
...{06}{07}
...{06}{07}
Are you fucking joking!?
If you expected me to answer
like that, then you are a
mother-fucking moron!{end}

Pull back, Cherie.
You don't stand a chance.{end}

D, don't be ridiculous!
I won't give up so easily!{end}

Then it can't be helped ...{end}

Uggghh ...!
No ... How could I ...
I can't ... see ...{end}

Farewell, {02}.{end}

It was heart-breaking
to see you go mad ...
Goodbye, {02}.{end}

Take that--!{end}

You've gotten stronger,
haven't you?{end}

Then I'll test
your strength myself.{end}

Aaaahh--!{end}

Are you okay, Hein!?
This isn't over yet.
Pull back and rest, friend.{end}

Aaah ...
Sorry ...{end}

Look! Retreat now!{end}

Ugh--! The pain ...{end}

Don't overdo it, Rohga.
I'll need your help later.{06}{07}
We can finish things here.
Go take a breather.{end}

Sorry ...{end}

Kill them!{end}

Aaaahhh--!
I'm ... I'm ...{end}

Fool! Don't be reckless!
If you die ...{end}

Don't do anything dangerous.
Go rest with Rohga.{end}

Sorry for making you worry.
I'll fall back for now.{end}

{font3}Oooohhh ...!{end}

{font3}Ugghh ... Arrgghhh--!
{font3}Have I been beaten!?{end}

Just be quiet and
go get some rest.{end}

{font3}Uggh ...{end}

{font3}These humans
{font3}smell unpleasant ...
{font3}Why is this ...!?{end}

That's because you've
reverted to your original form.{06}{07}
B{3a}ser's spell made you
bloodthirsty. With him dead,
you don't hunger for blood.{end}

{font3}So B{3a}ser made
{font3}us devour humans?{end}

{font3}I'm gonna devour you!{end}

Whoa ... Hey!
What are you saying!{end}

Are you all right?
Just go get some rest!{end}

Sorry ...{end}

{font3}These humans
{font3}smell unpleasant ...
{font3}Why is this ...!?{end}

That's because you've
reverted to your original form.{06}{07}
B{3a}ser's spell made you
bloodthirsty. With him dead,
you don't hunger for blood.{end}

{font3}So B{3a}ser made
{font3}us devour humans?{end}

Let's go, Cherie!{end}

Come at me, and
don't hold back!{end}

Won't you surrender?
I don't particularly enjoy
cutting down women.{end}

Never! If you're too
much of a coward, 
then I'm going after you!{end}

Well, I guess this
was inevitable ...{end}

I want to help {02}!{06}{07}
We will create a world
where humans and
demons may live in harmony!{end}

Humans and demons
can never coexist!{end}

I don't understand why!
It has to be all B{3a}ser's fault!{end}

I won't lose!
Watch me over me, Keith!{end}

Aaaahh--!{end}

Are you okay!?
Cherie!{end}

N, no ... I can't continue ...
I'm sorry ... everyone ...{end}

Cherie!{end}

How dare you ... kill Cherie ...
I won't allow this!{06}{07}
I'll never forgive you!{end}

N, no ...
I can't ... fight any more ...
{02} ...{06}{07}
How did ...{06}{07}
How did it end up like this?
We used to have ...
Th, the same dream ...{06}{07}
Those were ... good times ...{06}{07}
It's ... going black ...
where is ... can' t ... see ...
don't leave me ... {02}.{end}

Don't let them get in!
If they reach the celestial
realm, then all is lost.{end}

Aaarggghh!{end}

Lester, no!
Are you all right, Lester!?{end}

Heh heh ... Fuck me ...
I'll be honest ...
I'm not okay at all ...{06}{07}
Keith ... my friend ...
forgive me ... I couldn't
protect your princess ...{end}

This can't be! No!
Lester, Lester!{end}

Don't cry, ... Cherie.
Watching you cry,
it's ... heartbreaking.{end}

Lester!{end}

Farewell ...{end}

You ... You!
{02}, I'll never
forgive you!{end}

I won't let any more
of my friends die!{end}

Damn it ...!
I can't feel anything ...{06}{07}
You all think a
lone woman can't do
a thing, right?{06}{07}
Well, I'll hold you off for
a little while, and give Jessica
time to drain Langrisser.{06}{07}
I can do that much!{end}

...{end}

What's up, Keith.
Are you here to welcome me?{06}{07}
I thought you
might loathe me for not
protecting Cherie.{06}{07}
Aahhh ..., I know.
I'm going ... now ...{end}

Can't you beat me!?{end}

Fuck ...
how horrible ...{end}

Oh gods! Grant victory
to my allies ... Uuggghh--!{end}

T, the power of this gate ...
We must stop them at once ...!{end}

I'm dying near Heaven?
Well, at least it won't be
that far of a trip ...{end}

What the hell
are you saying!?{06}{07}
You're going to live!
Don't die on me!{end}

That's one order I can't obey.
Forgive me, Princess ...{end}

Lester ...
Sorry ...{end}

Are the magic
conduits disabled ...?{end}

S, so strong ...{end}

Why!?
Why can't I win?{end}

The left magic lithograph ...
dismantling ... was a failure ...{end}

Uugghh ...
The right lithograph...
Aaargghh--!{end}

The right magic lithograph ...
It's no good ...{end}

Farewell, Lester, Cherie.
May you rest in peace.{end}

Will we move on to
the heavens now?{end}

It's onward to the heavens
themselves, I suppose?{end}

Hey, this isn't good.
They're breaking!
How are we going to get back?{end}

Concentrate on moving
forward. We're committed now.{end}

That's right.
We'll finish what we've started.{06}{07}
Let's go, even if
a god is our enemy!{end}

All right ...!
I'm here for a status check.{end}

Just a little longer!
We're almost done ...{end}

We've finished!{end}

The two lithographs!
We couldn't even protect them!{end}

If they're broken ...
as I thought, it can't be done!
Everyone do your best!{end}

It looks like we can't dismantle
the central lithograph ...{06}{07}
If we can't do this, I won't
be able to look
Jessica in the eye ...{end}

{02}!{06}{07}
If we don't hurry,
Langrisser's energy will
fade forever!{end}

We did it!
We've moved the magic
symbols in order.{end}

We did it!
The ruins' are back
in working order.{end}

They've activated the ruins!
Jessica is in danger ...{end}

How could this happen,
after all our effort?{06}{07}
Stop them! They must
not pass through the gate!{end}

No good!
We weren't fast enough!{end}

Let's take this fight
to the heavens themselves!{end}

Yeah! Let's make a scene!{end}

Damn it!{end}

What have we fought for?
The death of our friends ...?{06}{07}
If only we'd surrendered
when Langrisser was taken ...{06}{07}
But ... Aaaah ...
Nothing ... can be done ...{end}

Cherie ... I'm sorry ...
We couldn't hold them off ...{06}{07}
Jessica, I ...
I hope you will safe ...{end}
