No!
Let me go!{end}

Hmmm.{end}

Aaahh!{end}

You're struggling in vain.
Calm yourself--
escape is impossible.{end}

Rest long and well for the
resurrection ceremony.
It really is very draining.{end}

...{end}

Silence is fine.{06}{07}
Just remember--
kindness is a courtesy.{end}

How go the
preparations?{end}

They are progressing smoothly.
By the way, is it okay for you
to go so long without resting?{end}

Hah hah hah ...
Who the hell do you
think you're dealing with?{06}{07}
A degree of magical
power and focus will be
required for the ritual ...{06}{07}
But these are simple
things for me.{end}

Ah, you can trust
your limits then.{end}

Hmmm, so this
is Velzeria?{end}

Let's hurry
up and land.{end}

Of course.
I had thought you'd
be landing here.{end}

{font3}Alhazard's ritual
{font3}of unsealing
{font3}will soon begin.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Every one of our
{font3}enemies must die here.{end}

I understand.{end}

Now, massacre
those whelps!{end}

We've become
quite a problem,
haven't we?{end}

Why is she in league
with darkness?{06}{07}
She's human, isn't she?
Doesn't she know
what's good for her?{end}

Yes, of course
she's human ...
She's Liana's older twin.{end}

Her mind must be 
under B{3a}ser's control.{06}{07}
That's the only explanation ...{end}

Do your best not
to injure L{37}na.{06}{07}
This will be hard
enough for Liana.{06}{07}
To have one's only
family as an enemy ...{end}

Hein, the battlefield's
an unpredictable place.
It's harsh and merciless.{06}{07}
We're trying to prevent
the revival of Alhazard.{06}{07}
If we lose sight of that,
we're at a disadvantage.{end}

Lester, I know
how you feel.{06}{07}
But let's just try and
do what we can for her!{end}

Leave those two to me,
and go easy on L{37}na!{06}{07}
Our team's not
going to lose this one.{06}{07}
It might get ugly, but let's
detain that "Dark Princess!"{end}

Heh heh heh ...{06}{07}
Come and get me.
If you can.{end}

Obliterate the
Descendants of Light!{end}

{font3}Leave it to us.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}We shall show the
{font3}puny humans our power.{end}

L{37}na's moving to
complete the ceremony.
Time's running out ...{end}

But where is the
ceremony taking place?{06}{07}
If we don't know,
we can't do anything.{end}

That's Jessica's job.{06}{07}
We need to concentrate
on breaking through.{end}

The ceremony is almost done.{06}{07}
Let's retreat!{end}

Weaklings, you
shall entertain me!{06}{07}
Finally, the age of
darkness has begun!{06}{07}
Gwa ha ha ha ...{end}

Ahh!
This feeling of dread ...{06}{07}
Alhazard's seal
has been broken!{end}

Wh, what does this mean!?{06}{07}
We couldn't stop the
Dark Blade's revival!{end}

Stop it, L{37}na.
B{3a}ser is already
dead, isn't he?{06}{07}
Why are you
following Egbert?{end}

Don't talk to me like
an old friend, trash.{06}{07}
Serving Lord B{3a}ser,
the Prince of Darkness,
suits me well.{06}{07}
And that's all
you need to know, ...
because you're going
to die here.{06}{07}
This is the last place
you will ever stand.{end}

{font3}Heh heh heh ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Hey there, my little
{font3}redheaded punk.
{font3}Come now, there is no
{font3}need to be so angry.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}We have shared
{font3}so many wonderful
{font3}memories together!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Remember Doren?
{font3}Remember him screaming
{font3}like a little bitch bathed
{font3}in his own blood?{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}I hope you will scream
{font3}for me the same way!{end}

You son of a bitch ...{end}

{font3}Gwa ha ha ha!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}You despise me?
{font3}You want to kill me?{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Hate and anguish
{font3}are my source of power!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Punk, let's see if you
{font3}still remember what
{font3}that old husk taught!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Wryyyyyyyyyy!{end}

{02},
don't give in to anger!{06}{07}
If you fight with rage
and pain in your heart, you'll
be no better than him!{end}

I know.
Thanks, Cherie ...
Doren said that too.{06}{07}
"No matter what
happens, you mustn't
lose sight of yourself ..."{end}

{02} ...{end}

I'm all right, Cherie.
Don't worry, okay?{06}{07}
If I lose my head, I'll have
no chance of winning.{end}

{font3}Hmmm ...
{font3}You must be the
{font3}leader, all right.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}You don't seem as
{font3}stupid as the rest.{end}

What!
You won't be talking so
highly of yourself for long!{end}

Well, the only one left is
Faias. You're all alone.{06}{07}
I'll avenge Doren's death!{end}

{font3}Don't make me laugh!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}You really think you
{font3}can beat me!?{end}

A fruit you've
never seen has fallen.{06}{07}

Will you eat it?{end}

MP raised by 4 points!{end}

Here ...
Am I really going
to die here?{end}

{font3}Very good ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}But your luck is
{font3}about to run out!{end}

You underestimate me.{end}

Damn!
Just as we were arriving
in Velzeria ...{end}

Ugh! Sorry ...
I wish I could
keep fighting ...{end}

Let's go!{end}

Argh!
It doesn't ... hurt--!{end}

That's it ... for me.
That attack was
really exhausting--{end}

Grrr!
In this important
time and place ...{06}{07}
Ow!
I'm retreating ...!{end}

I won't lose to some
demon's bastard child!{end}

Damn it!{end}

I've been negligent
with my battle form ...{end}

Oh ...
Alhazard's seal will be
broken, however ...{end}

You really should have been
stopped far earlier than this.{06}{07}
I guess we haven't taken
you seriously enough.{06}{07}
But, no matter.
This time we'll fight for real.{06}{07}
{font3}Go forth my servants!{end}

Impressive!
You possess such motivation.{06}{07}
Really, I would expect
nothing less from the
Descendants of Light.{06}{07}
How sad that I must finish you!{end}

Impossible ...
How could I lose to humans ...{end}

{font3}Ugghh ...{end}

{font3}Gaah--!{end}

{font3}How dare a
{font3}mortal oppose me!{end}

{font3}Ughh--aaaah!{end}

{font3}Ahh, sleep peacefully
{font3}on my bosom ...{end}

{font3}How dare you ...{end}

{font3}Argh!{end}

{font3}Ohhhh--!{end}

{font3}Oohhh ...{end}

{font3}Uggh--!{end}

{font3}Aaaahh ... Ah!{end}

{font3}Gahh--arrghh!{end}

{font3}I have an old score
{font3}to settle with you,
{font3}Descendants of Light.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Especially the
{font3}redheaded one.{end}

What score could you
possibly have with us?
We have never met.{end}

{font3}Ha ha ha!
{font3}You ... really don't
{font3}remember me?{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}I had hoped my
{font3}face would haunt
{font3}your nightmares for
{font3}all eternity.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}B{3a}ser ordered me
{font3}to massacre the
{font3}Descendants of Light.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}But when I finally
{font3}hunted you down,
{font3}this crumpled old
{font3}fool got in my way ...{end}

An old ...!{06}{07}
You ... then it was you!
You are the one
who murdered Doren!{end}

{font3}Doren ...
{font3}Hmmm, Doren ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Heh heh ...
{font3}Oh yes, that was his
{font3}name, I believe.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}That little bastard
{font3}dealt me a scratch that
{font3}aches even this day.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}But he's dead, and
{font3}you will soon rejoin him.
{font3}Today, I will dance
{font3}in your blood!{end}

For years I wandered ...
asking myself what I would do
if I found his murderer.{06}{07}
I will never forgive you.
Prepare yourself!{end}

{font3}Come and get me!
{font3}Let's go, whelp!{end}

{font3}I won't fail B{3a}ser!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}I'll wipe the 
{font3}Descendants' bloodline
{font3}from this world.{end}

{font3}I'll send you to hell!{end}

{font3}Heh heh heh ...
{font3}You flatter yourself!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}A mere human can't
{font3}defeat those who
{font3}channel the
{font3}powers of darkness!{end}

{font3}Powerful indeed ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}But even with that
{font3}level of skill, opposing
{font3}B{3a}ser is suicide!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}A horrible death
{font3}awaits you in Velzeria ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}If Alhazard is revived,
{font3}summoning those with my
{font3}power is simple.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Though you've beaten
{font3}me, raising a sword
{font3}to B{3a}ser is equal
{font3}to asking for death.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}See you in hell!
{font3}Fwa ha ha ha ...
{font3}Gwa ha!{end}

Doren ...
I've avenged you.
Rest in peace, my master ...{end}

By my own hand,
I've avenged you ...{06}{07}
I hope you can finally
rest in peace, Doren ...{end}

{font3}Gwa ha ha ha...
{font3}Cry, little boy!{end}

He was slain because I was
a Descendant of Light ...{06}{07}
Doren gave his life in
exchange for mine ...{06}{07}
Everyone close to me dies ...
I ... I cannot protect anyone.{end}

{02} ...{end}

{02} ...
You were destined to be born
a Descendant of Light.{06}{07}
But the reason your allies
fight beside you isn't
because of your heritage.{06}{07}
It's because we
believe in you.{end}

Yeah, {02}!{end}

What brought you this
far wasn't just that ...{06}{07}
It's not just because you
are a Descendant of Light,
it's your personality and
the choices you've made.{end}

Yes ...
It's still not too late.{06}{07}
We'll combine all our
strength, prevent Alhazard's
revival, and protect this world!{end}

But we must stop
the ceremony!{end}

Let's hurry, {02}.{06}{07}
If Alhazard's power is
restored, it will be too
much for us to handle.{end}

Let's hurry.
The ceremony to unseal
Alhazard has begun.{06}{07}
Let's go to the
Temple of Darkness
and defeat Egbert!{end}

Impossible ...
Have my battalions have
been destroyed?{06}{07}
What terrible strength ...
Was this destruction wrought
by the Descendants of Light?{end}

{font3}Dark Princess!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Egbert has finished
{font3}the preparations.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Please return to the
{font3}Temple of Darkness.{end}

Yes, I understand.
Until Alhazard is reborn,
I cannot die ...{06}{07}
I will live to witness
the new age of darkness!{end}

Yes, I see.
Alhazard's rebirth is
very close now.{06}{07}
Finally, the age of
darkness is nigh!{end}

It seems the preparations for
the ceremony are underway.{end}

There's no time.
We must attack now!
They must be stopped ...{06}{07}
We must prevent 
Alhazard's awakening!{end}

{font3}You won't interfere
{font3}with the revival
{font3}of Alhazard.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}To create our world of
{font3}darkness, we shall
{font3}protect Prince B{3a}ser
{font3}and General Egbert!{end}

It can't be helped.
We must break
through their lines.{end}

{font3}Interesting ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Then I'll share the
{font3}pain of this old wound
{font3}with you, boy!{end}

{font3}Arrggghhhh!{end}

{font3}Fwa ha ha.{06}{07}
{font3}We will burn the
{font3}Descendants of Light
{font3}to ashes!{end}

{font3}Ooohhhhh--!{end}

I'm sorry for being late.{06}{07}
I found the Temple of Darkness,
but I was forced to take
the long route on my return.{end}

You found it?{end}

Yes.
It's lies shortly
north of here.{06}{07}
The awakening ritual
is already underway.{end}

Jessica!
It seems that their
ritual has begun!{06}{07}
L{37}na has gone to the
Temple of Darkness.{end}

Jessica!
It seems the preparations
for the ceremony are over.{06}{07}
L{37}na has apparently gone
to the Temple of Darkness ...{end}

{02}, let's hurry!
We must stop
Alhazard's revival!{end}

Faias!
You can't escape me!
Ready yourself!{end}

{font3}How absurd.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}I'll make you bleed
{font3}just like that
{font3}worthless old man!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Wryyyyyyyyyy!{end}
