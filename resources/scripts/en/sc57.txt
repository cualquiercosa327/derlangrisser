...{end}

What's wrong, Liana?{end}

Liana ...?{end}

Ah ...{06}{07}
Nothing, really.
Nothing at all.{end}

It's hard, isn't it, Liana?
Having to fight him ...{end}

But, Sister ...{06}{07}
You too ...
Having to fight Leon ...{end}

Since B{3a}ser captured me,
I've lived a life of
darkness and servitude.{06}{07}
Of course, everyone
distrusted and loathed me ...{06}{07}
But he, Leon, was
the only one who treated
me with kindness.{06}{07}
He knew all along
that I was acting under
B{3a}ser's control ...{end}

...{06}{07}
You two need not fight
against your will.{06}{07}
If you wish to
return to their side,
I won't stop you ...{end}

I'm all right, really!{06}{07}
Since my release from B{3a}ser,
I've done a lot of thinking.{06}{07}
I'm a Descendant of Light,
and B{3a}ser taught me
to hate our way of life ...{06}{07}
But now that I'm free,
I've chosen to fulfil my duty.{06}{07}
Even if I must fight
those I love ...{end}

Sister ...{end}

However, Liana ...{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
You're a Descendant of Light.
Why have you chosen
to follow the Empire ...?{06}{07}
Lady Jessica,
why has {02} ...?{end}

As the Descendants of Light,
we, in good faith,
attempt the task before us.{06}{07}
But crushing darkness
through force may be superior
to our methods ...{06}{07}
These days, I've
often considered that ...{end}

Lady Jessica ...{end}

I, too, wish to
carry out my duty as
the Maiden of Light.{06}{07}
But I just can't ...
I can't fight him like this.
That's why ...{end}

...{end}

That's why I want
you to erase my memories!{06}{07}
I wish to forget ...,
I wish to forget {02}!{end}

Liana ...{end}

I see ...{06}{07}
Then in accordance with
with her wishes, I shall purge
Liana's memory ...{end}

Oh, god of time, knowledge,
and mercy! Wipe her mind
clean of strife and sadness.{06}{07}
{font4}La Halig Leoht ...
{font4}Claensian Sinre Gemynd!{end}

What ...?
What am I doing here ...?{end}

Liana ...
You went that far ...?{end}

Lady Jessica, watch out!{06}{07}
The enemy has finally
made its way here ...{end}

The top of Twin Castle ...
What a structure.{end}

By taking the central passage,
we've divided our forces.{06}{07}
In this situation,
our commanders will
prove their worth.{end}

We need to capture the
two Maidens, correct?{end}

That's right.
They'll be no good
to us dead.{06}{07}
Always remember that.{end}

Easier said than done ...{end}

I have some magic that
should simplify this.{06}{07}
Cover me while I make
my way to their position.{end}

If you want my opinion,
we should get rid
of that woman, Jessica.{06}{07}
She looks to be the
head of their group.{end}

Whatever works for you.
We just need to
retrieve the Maidens safely.{end}

You two ...
Please don't overdo it.{end}

No, in order to fight them,
we must use all our strength.{end}

I will honour my duty ...
As the Maiden of Light,
I'll fight until the end.{end}

So, you're finally here.{06}{07}
I suppose this is
the end for us.{end}

By the way, the princess ...?
What's happened
to Princess Cherie?{end}

I don't think there's any way
she would surrender.
Hence, she's probably ...{end}

Damn it!
This battle is for
you, Princess!{end}

Aaahhhh!
Get them!{end}

With darkness
destroyed, there's no longer
an enemy to fight.{06}{07}
But if you insist on
governing by force ...
We'll make sure you're worthy!{end}

It seems we're the
only ones left ...{06}{07}
Liana, L{37}na, please
escape while you can.{end}

No, Lady Jessica!
Why would you
say such a thing!?{end}

I feel the same ...
We will fight until the end
as Descendants of Light!{end}

Very well ...
Then let's give them
everything we have!{end}

Lady Jessica ...
No, I'll refer to you as
I did, as Master.{end}

Egbert ...{end}

Consider this, Master.
You cannot win.
Won't you surrender?{end}

It is a Descendant's
duty to keep Langrisser from
the wrong hands.{06}{07}
I reject your offer.{end}

Heh heh heh ... 
How interesting.{06}{07}
Your refusal, at least,
brings me a small pleasure.{06}{07}
I've always dreamt of a
wizard's duel with you ...{06}{07}
And I've learnt much since
your tutelage, Master Jessica,
as I'll be pleased to show!{end}

You open the treasure
chest to find a crimson lance.{06}{07}

Will you take the lance?{end}

Obtained Inferno Lance.{06}{07}

You hear a lock being
closed somewhere else.{end}

You open the treasure
chest to find a stone.{06}{07}

Will you take the stone?{end}

As you take the stone,
it emits a mysterious power.{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{06}{07}

You hear a lock being
closed somewhere else.{end}

This is a new era ...
And we, the people, should
fashion a new world to meet it.{end}

I wish to test you,
if you think you're so worthy!{end}

That ... that was it!?
Life is so fleeting ...{end}

Gahh--!
I've been killed ...{end}

Argh! I can't believe I lost
to a bunch of punks!{end}

L{37}na, forgive me.{06}{07}
Even if I'm an Imperial soldier,
I do not wish to fight you.{end}

Please don't let it bother you.
I'm no different, ... since
I am a Descendant of Light.{end}

I'm sorry ...{end}

Damn! {02},
take care of the rest!{end}

Well aren't you hot stuff?
I'm out of here!{end}

I've failed ...{end}

With my magic,
I shall remove the shackles
on my master ...{06}{07}
Those known as 
the Descendants of Light!{end}

Master, before my
death, I've always wished
to duel with you.{06}{07}
With the legendary sorceress
who returned from beyond ...{end}

Of all my students,
you possessed
the greatest talent.{06}{07}
Why did you waste it
serving a tyrant?{end}

In truth, I studied your magic
to banish the darkness.{06}{07}
With that goal complete,
I pursue greater aims ...{06}{07}
And wish to explore
the limits of my power.{end}

It seems you've acquired
more power than
you're fit to handle.{end}

What ...?
My magic was ineffective.{end}

That's enough ...{end}

Egbert, it was just 
a little longer ...{06}{07}
You could have brought
peace with the Descendants.{06}{07}
If you'd waited for us,
we'd have welcomed you.{end}

I'm sure my master is already
aware of the reasons.{06}{07}
In forbidden research,
I was nearly
possessed by demons.{06}{07}
My master would have me
face these creatures.
A terrifying prospect ...{06}{07}
I knew our strength was not
sufficient, and so, I chose
to aid His Majesty's Empire.{06}{07}
I had, at least, the power
and public favour to do that!{06}{07}
Hmph, it seems my
speech has gotten a bit lengthy.
We should finish things.{end}

Aaahhh! No ...
I'm finished too ...{06}{07}
With darkness defeated,
I guess the world ...
no longer needs Descendants ...{06}{07}
Maybe ... this was destiny ...{end}

...{06}{07}
Master, you've fulfilled
your duties admirably.{06}{07}
Please rest in peace ...
and leave this
world in our hands.{end}

Farewell, Jessica ...{end}

So this is the end of the
Descendants of Light?{06}{07}
With this, we shall
witness a new world ...{end}

Liana ...
I've never wanted to fight you.
Please, give this up.{end}

I am the Maiden of Light ...
Even if it costs my life,
I shall not abandon my duty!{end}

Aaaahh!{end}

Liana!{end}

Thank the goddess ...
You were not hurt.{06}{07}
I knew ... I knew I ...
couldn't bring myself to ...
defeat ... you ...{06}{07}
Because I've always ...
always ... {02} ...{end}

{02} ...?
I, I ... why ...
am I ... fighting ...?{end}

Liana ...!{end}

Goodbye, {02} ...
I love ... you.{end}

Liana!{end}

How could this have happened?
With Liana killed, we won't
be able to reseal Alhazard ...{end}

I can't do it.
I can't fight him ...{end}

Ugh!
N, no ...{end}

L{37}na ...{end}

You can't die, L{37}na!{end}

Thank you for
everything, Leon.{06}{07}
When I was under B{3a}ser's spell,
you told everyone it
wasn't me doing those things ...{06}{07}
I ... will never ... forget ...
your ... kindness ...{end}

Forgive me, L{37}na.
Rest in peace ...{end}

There's nothing we can do.
Our mission's a failure ...{06}{07}
How could we have let the
Maiden of Darkness die?{end}

Arrrgghhh!
I won't lose!{end}

You think I've ... lost ...?{end}

My power is ... fading ...{end}

I can't ... die!
Our kingdom ...{end}

It's all over for me, too.{end}

I beg your pardon,
Lady Jessica.{end}

Arrrggghhh!
My, my arm!{end}

At least ... 
I still have a weapon ...{end}

Gaahhh--!{end}

You will not pass!{end}

L, Lady Jessica ...{end}

This tower's troops have
been utterly destroyed ...{06}{07}
I would never have thought
they'd be this powerful ...{end}

I no longer feel
Cherie's presence.
They've probably ...{end}

{font4}Ecwyose Heolde Lufe!{end}

Ah, excellent.
This has simplified things.{end}

All that remains is
to challenge my master ...{end}

Who ... are you ...?{end}

Liana?
You don't know
who I am?{end}

Uuugghh ...
Please, just go away!{end}

{02}!?
Why, have I ...?{end}

My spell has been broken!?
How ...?{06}{07}
No, there's only one way.
Liana must ...{end}

Liana!
Do you know who I am!?{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
Lady Jessica sealed
my memory, but I still ...
remember you ...{end}

Your memory was
sealed, but your heart
still longs for him.{06}{07}
Those feelings must
run very deep ...{end}

Liana, I ...{end}

No ...! 
I am the Maiden of Light.{06}{07}
Protecting Langrisser ...
is my duty! That's why, I ...
Aaahhh ...!{end}

Why ...
Why are we enemies?{06}{07}
I don't want to fight,
but you left us ...
You abandoned me ...{end}

But, Liana!
That ...{end}

It's all right, I understand.
This world can be cruel ...{06}{07}
Let's do battle, {02},
and see whose ideal wins!{end}

I wonder why ...
when I want to fight you ...
I ... cry ...{end}

You erased your memories?{06}{07}
I don't understand ...!
Why would you do that?
Why must we fight at all!?{end}

This ... It's too painful ...
Don't talk to me!{end}

What do you mean?
Are you saying you 
have no idea who I am?{end}

Now then, you two
will be coming with me.{end}

...
We've lost, haven't we?{end}

L{37}na ...{end}

I understand ...
I won't resist ...{end}

I'll be taking you
with me, L{37}na.{end}

It looks like there's
no alternative ...{end}

We have the Sword of Light,
the Sword of Darkness,
and Maidens for each.{06}{07}
An impressive collection!
We're finally finished.{end}

And yet there remains
much to be done ...{06}{07}
A new era dawns!
Let us return to the
Imperial Capital!{end}

We have both swords
and both Maidens,
all that's needed.{06}{07}
A new era begins now!{06}{07}
Let us return to the
Imperial Capital.{end}

We have both swords
and both Maidens.
Our mission is finished.{end}

I pains me to say it ...
Without both
of the maidens ...{06}{07}
Alhazard shall never
be able to be sealed again.{end}

What worthless luck.
We have both swords ...{06}{07}
If only we could have
taken the Maidens, too ...{end}

It was a very ambitious goal.
Perhaps we were
just being unrealistic ...{06}{07}
From here on, we must act
as Alhazard's guardian.{06}{07}
It must never again
fall into evil hands.{end}

That's right.
Now, to the Imperial Capital!{end}

Now, let's return
to our Imperial Capital!{end}

Ah, Maiden of Light.
Come to me!{end}

Wh, what are you ...?{end}

Heh heh heh ...
Only the Maiden of Darkness
now remains.{06}{07}
This should prove easy enough.{end}

So, Maiden of Darkness.
Come to me!{end}

Ah, no thank you ...{end}

Heh heh heh ...
Only the Maiden of Light
now remains.{06}{07}
This should prove easy enough.{end}
