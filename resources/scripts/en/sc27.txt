Your Majesty!{end}

The Blue Dragon Knights
have been wiped out ... {06}{07}
We tried to hold our enemy
at the castle wall, but the
Imperial Army succumbed.
The gate has fallen ...{end}

Really ...
How troublesome.{end}

Yes ...
Ughhh!{end}

I can't believe
Leon failed ...{06}{07}
Quickly, prepare
the ambush!{06}{07}
This is as far as
the enemy gets!{end}

You've come quite
a way, my friends.{06}{07}
Such is the power
of Langrisser.{end}

You're mistaken!{end}

It was our belief in
ourselves that brought
us this far!{06}{07}
Langrisser's power is
drawn from our faith ... {06}{07}
With that, we shall
defeat you and turn back
the tide of darkness!{end}

That's right!
That's the true power
of Langrisser!{end}

A tyrant like you
wouldn't know the real
strength of Langrisser!{end}

I've heard enough!{06}{07}
I have crushed every
obstacle in my path,
and you are no different.{06}{07}
In the face of power,
people are merely
tools for my bidding.
Power brings wealth.{06}{07}
With force, one can
accomplish anything. Yes, ...
even rule the world!{06}{07}
The mighty Alhazard bestows
upon me the means to conquer,
and I intend to follow through!{end}

How foolish ...
You're wrong, Bernhardt!{end}

Gwa ha ha ha ...
I won't give in to
your babble! {06}{07}
If I take Langrisser
from you runts,
there won't be a soul
left to oppose me. {06}{07}
Come forth, my
minions of the night!{end}

By the virtue of Light's Blade
and the burning blood of
the Descendants in my veins ...{06}{07}
I shall emerge victorious!{end}

The only stable peace
will be through the
unification of this continent.{06}{07}
And if our new nation
were lax and impotent,
no man would follow it.{06}{07}
An iron-fisted ruler to 
govern over all, that's the
only solution for this world!{end}

Hold it right there!{06}{07}
You won't lay a finger
on His Majesty!{end}

Leon!?{end}

Don't push yourself, Leon.{06}{07}
Don't waste your life ...{end}

No!
I am the Commander of
the Blue Dragon Knights!{06}{07}
Allow me to fulfil my duty!{end}

What devotion ...{06}{07}
You have my thanks.{end}

Thank you,
Your Majesty!{06}{07}
You won't regret this.{end}

Bernhardt!{06}{07}
It's over!
Your evil ambitions
are finished!{end}

Funny little man ...{06}{07}
Do what you will!
I'm eager to see
what you can do.{end}

I made it here
just to die ...{end}

Damn ...{end}

Leon!
Why do you
continue to fight?{06}{07}
For us to fight
each other is
such a waste!{end}

I will not explain
myself again ...{06}{07}
As a Knight, I will
battle to my death.{end}

En garde!{end}

I'm sorry everyone.{06}{07}
I'm done for ...{end}

Prepare yourself, Bernhardt!{06}{07}
There will be no sunrise
for you this morning!{end}

This is outrageous!
How could I lose here ...
of all the places!?{end}

This is it!
The Empire's history
ends here.{end}

I don't think so.{06}{07}
You think you
can beat me ...
How foolish.{end}

Arghh ...
I screwed up ...{end}

I have no quarrel with you,
but you're still gonna die!{end}

Sorry!
I blundered ...{end}

Alhazard was never meant
to be reawakened ... {06}{07}
We must seal its
power for good!{end}

In that case, you
must defeat me!{end}

Sorry.
I'll have to retreat ...{end}

Leon ...{06}{07}
If you must fight,
then I will be the one
to put you to rest ...{end}

Misery is a law of 
the battlefield.{06}{07}
There are times
when even brothers must
cross swords ...{end}

Give us Alhazard!{end}

Hmph!
What power has a
lone woman?{end}

Arrggh!
I can't die here ...{end}

Let us put an end
to this battle between
light and dark ...{end}

Sorry.
I'll retreat.{end}

Let's go!
Let's finish this war!{end}

Uggh!
I'm done for ...{end}

Let's go, {02}!{end}

Leon, stop it!
Serving your fallen
Empire is meaningless!{end}

My word is my life
and my bond.
I will not turn from it!{06}{07}
I persist not for
our Empire alone.{06}{07}
I act in accord with
my oath to His Majesty!{end}

Leon, please stop!
Your wounds ...{06}{07}
You'll die if you 
keep fighting!{end}

Nothing happens
but for will alone.{06}{07}
My will is strong.{06}{07}
I shall fight ...
until my hands can no
longer grasp this blade.{06}{07}
Until this body can
move no longer ... {06}{07}
Until the very end ...{06}{07}
For I vowed to fight
in His Majesty's name,
and I keep my oath!{end}

Gahh--!{end}

Leon!
Any more fighting is
meaningless!{end}

Are you trying to
offer me mercy?{06}{07}
I can fight still!{end}

Stop it.
You've no strength
left to fight.{end}

Well done, Leon.
Thank you for showing
me such devotion.{06}{07}
You've done enough.
I permit you to fall back.{end}

Yes, Sir--!{end}

Don't get cocky
about Leon's defeat.{06}{07}
As long as I am alive, you
cannot destroy this Empire,
nor will you take Alhazard ... {06}{07}
If you wish to slay me,
then give it all your might.{06}{07}
But be warned,
the final victory
shall be ours ...{end}

No ...
We will win this battle!
We must win this battle!{end}

Egbert,
you're mistaken!{end}

There exists but one truth. {06}{07}
However, there are
an infinite number of
roads to reach it ... {06}{07}
Wouldn't you agree?{end}

Ha ha ha ...{06}{07}
Reckless fools ...{end}

This is quite unfortunate,
Lady Jessica. {06}{07}
How terrible for
you to come here and ...{06}{07}
Well, I suppose there's
no alternative.
Prepare yourself!{end}

Your Majesty ...
Please forgive me ...{end}

Egbert,
it's quite all right.
Please, fall back.{end}

But Your Majesty ... {06}{07}
We are clearly at a
disadvantage, and I have one
teleportation spell left.{06}{07}
Why don't you
escape with me?{end}

Egbert, I will never retreat,
no matter what the situation.{06}{07}
I have the power of a god!
My ability is at its height.{06}{07}
If someone wields the
strength to defeat me now,
then I can never succeed.{06}{07}
Here, this day,
I will face my fate.{06}{07}
Egbert, please retreat ...
You can't fight
with your injuries.{end}

I'm so sorry.
Best of luck ...{end}

Ha!
I'll never run away!{06}{07}
Come here and fight!{end}

I will use these
servants for all time.{end}

{font3}I am an immortal.
How can I die ...?
Gahhh---!{end}

{font3}I, impossible!{end}

Arrghhh ...!{end}

Ugghh!{end}

Your Majesty!{end}

I'm ... so ... rry ...{end}

{font3}Gahh--aarghh!{end}

Your Majesty!{end}

Hah hah hah.
Outstanding!{06}{07}
As I expected, the divine
power of Langrisser is
no match for Alhazard
in the proper hands.{end}

That's wrong!
What defeated you was the
power of cooperation!{end}

Thus is the message
of Langrisser ...{06}{07}
People's hearts are weak.
They're filled with 
jealousy, distrust, 
resentment and betrayal ... {06}{07}
These fickle emotions,
they are the source
of all petty conflicts.{06}{07}
How can people live
in harmony when they can't
control themselves?{06}{07}
It won't happen.
Citizens will never take
responsibility. They will
never stop killing.{06}{07}
From the time I was
just a young soldier,
I've thought it disgusting.{06}{07}
And I thought, ...
Somebody, if somebody could
only take control ... {06}{07}
If there was an absolute
ruler, only then could wars
be a fading memory.{06}{07}
Therefore power,
the power to rule all,
has been my sole desire.{end}

...{end}

But the way I forced
my reign on others
was no better.{06}{07}
Hah ...{06}{07}
In the end, I was just
another weak man who had
no faith in humanity.{end}

Kaiser Bernhardt ... {06}{07}
The war is over.
Give yourself up, for the
good of the people ...{end}

Not a chance!
Though I admit defeat, I am
the proud Kaiser of Rayguard!{06}{07}
I won't die by
your sword!{06}{07}
I'd rather leave this
world than submit to you!{06}{07}
Alhazard,
grant me the strength
of the gods!{end}

Ahhhh!
Alhazard's power is
going wild!{end}

The sword's magic
is going crazy!{end}

Your Majesty,
I will join you!{end}

Leon ...,
now isn't the time
for you to die.{06}{07}
You must live to
witness the end
of the Empire!{end}

A world without
His Majesty ...
has no meaning to me.{06}{07}
I've taken His Majesty's
ideals as my own and I've done
much to defend them ... {06}{07}
I embrace our vision,
and I will see it through.{06}{07}
Your Majesty,
even if it leads
to my death ...
{06}{07}
Please allow me to
fight by your side until you
draw breath no longer!{end}

Your words ...
Do as you wish.{end}

Leon--{end}

{02}...
I leave this
continent to you.{06}{07}
At the least, 
with El Sallia in your care,
I can rest easy.{end}

Leon!{end}

I'm sorry, L{37}na ...{06}{07}
Until my death,
I want to remain true
to what I've believed in.{end}

Leon--
I'll go, too!
I want to be with you!{end}

L{37}na, no!
You mustn't
take your own life!{end}

I'm sorry ...
I can't let you do that,
my Dark Princess.{06}{07}
Thank you and ...
Goodbye L{37}na,
my sweet love ...{end}

No ...
No! Leon!{06}{07}
Nooooo!{end}

Obtained Alhazard.{end}

Whew, we did it ...{end}

How could the 
Descendants of Light
make it here-- {06}{07}
This is impossible!
Why, why was I defeated?{06}{07}
Did I overestimate
my abilities?{end}

Leon ...{end}

After this long fight,
all that remains
is this--Alhazard.{06}{07}
What a tragic war
this has been ...{end}

Hmmm, does a 
competent ruler
require strength ...?{end}

So, does a capable
ruler need power?{end}

That's why you
mustn't use the 
power of darkness.{06}{07}
From the beginning, 
darkness has been 
the enemy of humanity.{end}

Alhazard was forged from
people's lust for power.{end}

But now, the battle is over.{end}

Now, let's put a
stop to this war. {end}

Arrrgh ...!
My head--! The pain!{end}

Liana?
What's wrong?{end}

Anger ...
Sadness ...
Hatred! It comes to me!{end}

Liana?
What's the matter!?{06}{07}
Liana!{end}

Everyone, be careful.{06}{07}
A great aura
of evil is ... {06}{07}
I have a bad feeling
about this, {02}.{end}

Alhazard was taken!{end}

Alhazard is
mine at last!{06}{07}
Ha ha ha ...
Now I can revive Chaos!{06}{07}
Now, I have the
power I've wished for.{end}

Sonya!{end}

With this, I can destroy
humans and the world!{06}{07}
Everyone, 
everything will burn!
{font3}Aha ha ha!{end}

Let's hurry!{06}{07}
If we track the evil
flowing from Alhazard, we
can find her hideout!{end}

Okay!
Hurry and guide us!{end}

Egbert,
individually, we may
have little power.{06}{07}
But when enough raindrops
gather closely, they become
a stream, a river, a torrent.{06}{07}
That is the
power of light.{end}

When B{3a}ser's rebirth
drew near, I first
believed ...{06}{07}
I believed that the
Descendants of Light would
combine their strength
and overcome him.{06}{07}
However, their power
was plainly insufficient
at the time.{06}{07}
And when I encountered
His Majesty in his youth,
I had a vision ...{06}{07}
I foresaw that he could
grow to surpass the
Dark One and defeat him!{06}{07}
Our Kaiser believed that a
united, glorious nation
could one day bring
about a peaceful world.{06}{07}
I cooperated with him
for that reason, to be
able to realize his dream.{end}

Really ...{06}{07}
Then that's why you left
Jessica to me and
left right after her rebirth?{end}

Now that B{3a}ser and Bernhardt
have been defeated, there is
no point in fighting us!{06}{07}
Egbert, my student!
I will offer you one more
chance to study the infinite
possibilities of magic.{end}

Of course, there is no
more reason to fight.{06}{07}
But I have no right
to call you teacher.{06}{07}
Jessica, please
take care. {06}{07}
Farewell,
Descendants of Light ... {06}{07}
I will quietly watch
what you do
with this new world.{end}

Egbert ...{end}

Damn, I guess he
wasn't that bad of a
guy after all.{end}

How could this be ...
His Majesty was defeated ... {06}{07}
It's the end!
The Empire is finished!{end}
