No word yet from
our Salrath squad?{end}

No, there's been none.{end}

Makes sense ...
I knew the Empire would
eventually invade ...{06}{07}
But if Salrath has fallen,
we'll face the enemy here!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

This is our target.
Those troops bear
Salrath's standard ...{end}

Yes. Before we take Kalxath,
we'll need to neutralise them.{end}

Looks like we'll be dealing
with the old swordsman again.{end}

And he's nice and ready
for us. What a great
welcome they've prepared.{end}

We'll just make sure we're
the life of this
little party! Tee hee!{end}

They've guessed our plan.
I'm sure they're here to
pre-empt our march on Kalxath.{end}

This could hardly be
more difficult ...{06}{07}
In all my days, I never
thought I would face
all of the Empire's
Four Heavenly Dragons ...{end}

Lord Aaron ...{end}

I'll be candid.
We don't have much
of a chance here.{06}{07}
I'll buy you time.
Please, go now.{end}

There are villagers here.
They needn't be involved.{06}{07}
Direct arms only
against our enemy!{end}

For Kalxath's benefit,
I really should
divert their attention.{end}

Lord Aaron, please,
think about this!{end}

Don't worry about an old man.
Please, leave the field.{end}

Y, you have our
thanks, Lord Aaron.{end}

All right, men!
Let's show the Empire what
a real army is all about!{end}

Aaron, it seems, is
too old to fear death.{06}{07}
Arranging for his allies'
retreat by offering
himself as a shield ...{06}{07}
His subordinates share in
his sentiment. They'll
probably fight to the last man.{end}

They want to play martyr?
What crap. I'll kill
them all just the same.{end}

It may be meaningless to you ...
but to a Knight, this
is a sign of great respect.{end}

War is war for mercenaries.
There's nothing special
about wasting your life.{06}{07}
A mercenary doesn't fight
for ideals, he fights for money.{end}

You spot a water fowl perched
atop a nearby small post.{06}{07}

The bird is holding a small,
glittering stone in its beak.{06}{07}

What will you do?{end}

Startle it{end}

Reach out{end}

Ignore it{end}

The water bird gets scared,
drops the stone and flies away.{06}{07}

The stone sinks to the
bottom of the lake.{end}

The bird drops the stone
in your hand and flies away.{06}{07}

You wash the stone and
it emits a mysterious glow.{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

The bird finally flies away.{end}

Let's see what you can do!{end}

Let's go!{end}

Uughh, damn!
I wanted to die in bed ...{end}

Ho!{end}

Argh, I'm done for--!{end}

Damn, the wound is deep!
No choice but to pull out!{end}

Curses!
What a mistake--!{end}

I'll remember this!{end}

Ugh! My sword ...{end}

How sad. Against my magic,
you're completely helpless.{06}{07}
At least I can give you
a quick trip to hell ...{end}

Heh heh heh ...
Go ahead, play your games.
They'll do you no good.{end}

So, you've followed me this far?
You're really determined ...
I'd better keep my distance.{end}

Sir Aaron, wh, what
should we do ...?{end}

There is no reason
to ask him for
protection or orders.{06}{07}
You are not our enemy.
We have no desire to fight
with or harm civilians.{06}{07}
However, I can't guarantee
your safety if you remain here.
Please leave quickly
for your own protection.{end}

O, okay.{end}

Hoh hoh ...
Quite admirable, for an
agent of the Empire.{06}{07}
You interest me ...
Your name is
{02}, right?{end}

Correct. We're not here
to cause suffering
nor to pillage homes.{06}{07}
We will always permit
civilians safe
passage from battle.{end}

Hmmm ... If we weren't enemies,
I'd very much like to
share a drink with you.{end}

Heart warming.
But, as you say, we are
here to kill each other.{end}

As the Empire wishes ...
I will not hold back!{end}

Sir Aaron ...
Somehow, be safe ...{end}

Aaahhh!{end}

Thank you, Sir Aaron.
I won't forget your kindness.{end}

Aaahh!{end}

I've lived a long and
fulfilling life ...{06}{07}
And I won't give
it up easily!{end}

I may be old, but
this sword's
as steady as ever!{end}

Th, this is ...
the end ...{end}

Are we too late ...?{end}

Aaron!
Pull yourself together!{end}

Oh, Princess ...
Watching over you ...
has made me very happy.{end}

St, stop that!
What are you saying?{end}

Please, listen ...
Don't waste your efforts here.
Hurry and return to Kalxath.{06}{07}
The Empire is strong.
But you and Keith can
protect the castle ...
You can ward them off ...{06}{07}
Cherie, I always knew you'd
make a wonderful princess ...
You made an old man proud ...{06}{07}
Will you do this for me?{end}

...{06}{07}
Y, yes ...{end}

Thank you ... 
Whew, I'm tired ...
I'll, I'll just rest for a while ...{end}

A, Aaron!{end}

Princess, this may sound
cold, but now isn't
the time to mince words.{06}{07}
If we stay here and fight,
Aaron will have died in vain.
We'll share his fate.{06}{07}
His final thoughts were wise ...
We must make our
stand at Castle Kalxath.{end}

Keith, what good would
fortifying our castle do?{06}{07}
We can't win against
{02} and the
Four Heavenly Dragons!{06}{07}
Kalxath is finished ...
We're finished ...{end}

Cherie, get a hold of yourself!
If we give in, what
has Sir Aaron fought for?{end}

Y, you're right ...
Keith is right, as always.{06}{07}
No more tears ...
I'll do my best
from here on out.{end}

{02}!{06}{07}
We're sick of your lies!
We're sick of the pain and
death you've caused!{06}{07}
The Empire's dream,
its vision, has done nothing
but kill goodhearted people ...{06}{07}
It's a showdown, {02}!
I'll wait for you at Kalxath!{end}

{02} ...{end}

...{06}{07}
Don't fret about it, Hein.
After all, I was prepared
for a few wounded feelings.{06}{07}
Always remember, we're
fighting so tomorrow's children
won't need to endure this ...{06}{07}
We'll end this
dark age ourselves!{end}

...{06}{07}
Well, I've been prepared for a
few wounded feelings.{06}{07}
Always remember, we're
fighting so tomorrow's children
won't need to endure this ...{06}{07}
We'll end this
dark age ourselves!{end}

We should strike
Kalxath quickly.{06}{07}
They're undoubtedly preparing
some heavy fortifications.{end}

Let's move on to
Kalxath now.{06}{07}
The longer we wait,
the less our chance
of taking the castle.{end}

Very true. Let's hurry.
After Kalxath falls,
our opposition will be halved.{06}{07}
And unification will be
within our grasp.{end}

I'm entrusting our
southern defence to you.{06}{07}
However, our enemy may
attack from the north as well.
Be cautious.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

I'll protect Sir Aaron!{end}

Sir Aaron,
I'm so sorry ...{end}

A sword in my good hand
is worth a thousand of your
bumbling men. Watch this!{end}

At least I was able to
see the whole Imperial Army
in coordinated action ...{06}{07}
Quite a sight ...{end}

It's possible that
the enemy will attack
from both sides.{06}{07}
I want you to
handle all who move
in from the north.{end}

Understood!{end}

I'll bury you here!{end}

S, strong ...{end}

Noooo--!{end}

Ugh!{end}

If we want to turn this
battle around, I'm 
going to need your help.{06}{07}
Magicians, defend
this point and bombard
them with magic!{end}

As you wish.{end}

Imperial soldiers,
I'll see you in hell!{end}

Th, this is it ...{end}

Water really slows
them down.{06}{07}
Take advantage of that
and hit them hard.{end}

Aye Sir!
Leave the river
fight to me!{end}

You have skill, all right.
But you won't be so
boastful when you're dead.{end}

If I only were stronger ...{end}

Hey, quit fucking around!{end}

Your abilities are
no match for mine ...{end}

Sir Aaron, we won't
run off and leave you to die!{06}{07}
We will remain at
your side until the end!{end}

Whew. Looks like
everyone has made
it out okay ...{06}{07}
I may be the only one
left, but I'll fight for Kalxath
until I fall dead.{end}

Whew. Looks
like everyone's made
it out okay ...{06}{07}
No need to worry any more.
Now I can focus on 
doing some real damage.{06}{07}
You all had better leave, too.
There's no point
in sticking around.{end}

Are you trying to
throw your life away ...?{end}

We really didn't expect
them to be this powerful.{06}{07}
Be careful ...{end}

...{06}{07}
I see. You really are
a stubborn bunch.{06}{07}
So you want to join me
until the end, do you?{06}{07}
Well then, brave men,
let's route these Imperials
for the honour of Kalxath!{end}

Arrghh ...
This has turned into a
hard-fought skirmish.{end}

The Empire's strength should
not be underestimated. It's
always a quite fatal mistake ...{end}

Until the continent is unified,
we cannot afford to lose!{end}

Damn! The front line's
been bowled over!?{06}{07}
Those Four Heavenly Dragons
live up to their reputation ...{06}{07}
But I think they'll enjoy
my sword techniques.
Each is well known for its
eviscerating potential.{06}{07}
Defeating me won't
be a merry stroll!{end}

Sounds interesting!
We'll see whose
swordsmanship is superior.{end}

Sacrifices may be necessary, ...
but I will not lose!{end}
