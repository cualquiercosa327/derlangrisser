There has been no
word from Imelda ...{06}{07}
Laird, this will
be our final battle.{06}{07}
Fight with honour and glory.
Remember our Kaiser and
his vision for a new world.{06}{07}
Let us take the positions
outside the castle
that we discussed before.{06}{07}
Are our men read for
the spread-formation attack?{end}

Yes, everything is
ready for your command.{end}

General Leon, forgive me, 
but what position could be
better than in a castle?{end}

We have weapons
that cannot be used inside
the castle gates.{06}{07}
Our fields will provide
{02} with far more
trouble, I assure you.{end}

I see.{end}

In addition to defending,
I will head our charge.{end}

Everyone, remember
my orders. I will repeat
them one last time.{06}{07}
The enemy will meet
our bottleneck, and their
men will begin to file.{06}{07}
When this occurs, strike
them from all angles!
Do not lose this chance!{06}{07}
All right, move out!{end}

Twin Castle is just ahead.{end}

You will not pass, {02}.
Our fates and the Kaiser's
are one and the same.{end}

So Leon, you've worked up
the courage to stand.{06}{07}
I wish you'd thrown
a bigger party for us.{06}{07}
This one looks set
to dull rather quickly.{end}

Be careful, {02}.
These guys
aren't messing around.{end}

So I see.{06}{07}
They stand between us and
Bernhardt--and for that,
they will regrettably die.{06}{07}
The Blue Dragon Knights
have outlived their Empire.{end}

{02}, this
will be our last battle.{06}{07}
You sound ready.
Let us begin.{end}

Yes, let's get started.
I believe another
dead Empire fought here.{06}{07}
It's a fitting
site for your grave.{end}

...{06}{07}
You shall come to
regret those words.{end}

{02}!{end}

I, I ...{end}

...{06}{07}
I suppose there is
nothing more to say.{end}

Leon ...{end}

Glory to our Knights,
and glory to our Empire!{06}{07}
Let our righteousness
shine like the stars!{end}

Fellow Knights, a loss
here means the end to us ...
to our noble history.{06}{07}
If you have a hidden reserve,
tap it. Leave no ounce of
your skill from this battle.{06}{07}
You are the Elite Knights of
His Majesty's Royal Guard.
You are the world's finest men.{06}{07}
Show our enemy why
we are known as the strongest
in this great continent!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Leon, there's really no
reason to fight, is there?
Let's combine our efforts!{end}

{02}, my hands
may be dyed in blood ...{06}{07}
But I will never
touch filth like you.{end}

Leon, please stop this!{06}{07}
What matters more? The person
who brings peace to this
land, or that there is peace?{06}{07}
In a few years, the Kaiser
will be nothing but dust.
Control will fall to another
man who may be less able.{06}{07}
Why are you so against
darkness? Even your Kaiser
used it as a tool to achieve
his Rayguard dream ...{end}

Dark Princess ...
I ... pity you.{06}{07}
You are B{3a}ser's toy,
and when he tires, you
shall learn what our Empire
strove to oppose.{end}

Well, I see one thing.
I see you don't properly
respect my power.{06}{07}
Leon, your ideals meant
nothing. You were simply
the largest dog in the kennel.{end}

You found a small locked box.
The outside has an inscription.{06}{07}

"Would you,
Knowing what's in store,"{06}{07}

"Memory relegated to lore,
Choose this life once more?"{end}

The small box turned
to rust and vanished.{end}

The box opens up
with a satisfying squeak.{06}{07}

You lift out the precious
gem from within the box.{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

As you step into a thicket, a
chain coils around your feet.{06}{07}

Will you cut it off?{end}

The chain instantly turns
to dust before your eyes.{end}

You carefully remove
the chain using your hand.{06}{07}

Moments later,
it begins to sparkle.{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{end}

After a little while, a
large tree begins speaking.{06}{07}

"You ... human ... Will you
please unshackle that chain?"{06}{07}

"That bothersome metal has
encircled me for so long ..."{end}

Chop it off{end}

Remove it by hand{end}

Ignore the tree{end}

In severing the chain with
your sword, you injure the tree.{06}{07}

The large tree falls silent.{end}

Using your hands, you
courteously remove the chain.{06}{07}

"Thank you ... that chain was
a burden these thousand years."{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{end}

The tree gives up
and remains silent.{end}

The war is over,
and everyone has a score.
Why are you resisting?{end}

Darkness will not
rule this land.{06}{07}
I am a man of
principles, and that
is my most dear.{end}

Ugh ... 
Im, impossible ...{end}

You are beaten, {02}.{06}{07}
At last ...
This bitter is nearing
its end ...{end}

So that was
my last breath ...{end}

Trying to swing
a sword, are you, {02}?{end}

F, forgive me ...{end}

Shit, they're vicious ...{end}

I'm ... I'm just ...
a little tired ...{end}

{font3}Oooohhh ...!{end}

{font3}Aaahhh!{end}

L{37}na ...{end}

Leon, I don't want you to die.
Won't you please join
{02} in his cause?{end}

Absolutely not.{end}

Then at least surrender!{end}

That I must also refuse.{06}{07}
However, as a gentleman,
I extend you the same offer.{end}

I'm ... I'm afraid I can't.
I suppose we must fight.
Get ready, Leon!{end}

Leon ...{end}

Forgive me, L{37}na ...{end}

Aaahhh--!
Wh, why ...?{end}

Go! This will
be our final assault!{end}

How can this be ...?
The Blue Dragon Knights
reduced to one man ...{06}{07}
This is too much to bear.
But ... No, I will fight ...
I will fight for tomorrow!{end}

{02}, tell me ...{06}{07}
Why, why have
you sold your soul?{end}

He with power shall rule.
Be he man or demon.
Be it Empire or darkness.{06}{07}
Do not blame the
natural order, Leon.{end}

{02} ...
You're not worthy
of being human.{end}

The Knights will ...
We will ... we will ...!
Arrgghh ...!{06}{07}
I beg your forgiveness, Laird.
Tell His Majesty ... Tell him ...{end}

Uugghh ...{end}

Leon, collect yourself.
Stand ... Leon!{end}

Don't be concerned, Laird.
I won't die from ...
a few ... scratches ...{end}

Somebody, escort
General Leon inside!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Leon, rest easy.
I shall give my life
for the cause ...!{end}

Ugh ...
Nice one ...{end}

General Leon, please retreat!{end}

This battle carries ...
far too much weight.{06}{07}
Wounds have no importance ...
Nothing matters more!{end}

You're correct, General.
That is why we shall
succeed in your stead.{end}

That's right.
Leave this one to us!{end}

Thank you, c, comrades ...
Very well, for once ...
I shall do as you say ...{end}

We fight here for the
future of this world.{06}{07}
We sought to create
an Empire, to
end the bloodshed ...{06}{07}
{02} will drench
this world in more
blood than we have seen.{06}{07}
If we fail here, the Empire ...
We shall fail every
person on this continent.{06}{07}
We cannot lose!
Understand!? We cannot!
Attack! Attack for everyone!{end}

{02} ...
You have to be stopped!{end}

What ...?
Wait one moment.{end}

You betrayed Leon.
I can ... I can never ...
I can never forgive you!{end}

Prepare yourself!{end}

General Leon, Sir ...
It appears as though this
is where I depart ...{end}

Laird, stand up.
We still have
a battle to fight.{06}{07}
Laird, come on.
Take my ...{06}{07}
Laird ...?{06}{07}
Oh Laird!
You won't die here, 
I won't permit it ...!{06}{07}
Laird, get up!{end}

General, thank you ...
for giving me
something to fight for.{06}{07}
Not everyone ...
has such a privilege ...{end}

Stop talking nonsense!
Hell won't see
you before it sees me!{06}{07}
Open your eyes, Laird.
Please, open your eyes!{end}

Aaaarrrgghhh!{06}{07}
Again, I've lost
my closest friend ...{06}{07}
Why, {02}?
No human could do this.
How can you ...{06}{07}
God damn you, how!?{end}

So your weakness
has finally shown.
Are you finished?{end}

I ... expected nothing.{06}{07}
{02}, I have my sins,
but at least I'll leave this world
knowing I spared it from you.{06}{07}
I have no purpose save
for killing you!{end}

You won't
escape from here!{end}

G, General Leon ...,
Forgive me ...{end}

I'm sorry, men ...
I'm sorry you must sacrifice
yourselves here.{end}

Turn them away!
Keep them from our Kaiser!{end}

Do you think you can
breach our ironclad defence?{end}

I have no choice ...
M, Must fall back!{end}

Fear not, soldier.
You can leave
the rest up to me.{06}{07}
I will crush them all!{end}

Glory to the
Rayguard Empire!{end}

I lived by the sword,
and die by the same ...{end}

Have at you!
These shall be your
last breaths!{end}

My mobility wasn't ...
so great an advantage ...{end}

General Leeooonnn!{end}

O, ouch!
Death hurts this mu--!?{end}

We will do our best!
For the glory of Rayguard and
the Blue Dragon Knights!{end}

As a Blue Dragon Knight,
I served the
Empire to the end ...{end}

Let's go!
Have a taste of my magic!{end}

I shall be the one
to avenge General Leon!{end}

You ... 
shall not get ...{end}

I ... have to defeat--{end}

So ends General Leon.
He was a formidable opponent,
and that's a certainty.{end}

Leon ...{end}

He had courage,
but not enough ...,
I suppose.{06}{07}
Now we can enter the castle.
This will finally mark the end
of the Empire, won't it?{end}

An old man and his
delusions can scarcely be
called an Empire.{06}{07}
After we crush that old man,
only the Descendants of Light
shall remain ...{06}{07}
They should be entertaining.{end}

Liana ...{end}

That's right.
First, let's defeat Bernhardt.{end}

Bernhardt is the last
crutch of his own Empire.{06}{07}
Let's scratch that itch and
move on to the Descendants.{06}{07}
After them, the world
will be ours to enjoy.{06}{07}
Everyone, move out!{end}

It shall not come to pass!{06}{07}
Even if Leon falls here,
others will carry
the Empire's vision!{end}

Leon, our manoeuvres
have been successful.{end}

Don't rest yet.
Our real foe is {02}.{06}{07}
He won't stop until we
wrest his life from his hands.{end}

Is it some kind of ambush?
Hurry! Tell everyone!{end}

Now, it's our turn!
Everyone, let's go!{end}

Is this it?{end}

Attack from the sky!{end}

Is this it!?{06}{07}
Has the end finally come?
At long last, perhaps
there can be ... balance ...{end}
