Great and gloried Chaos,
reveal thy splendour!{end}

Don't wear yourself out, girl ...
This will be quite taxing.{end}

Disperse the light and
purge its binding ...
express your dark nature ...{06}{07}
O, Alhazard, return
thy true power now!{06}{07}
{font4}Al Hassaerto ...
{font4}Aul Alwazart ...!
{font4}Ay Alhazard!{end}

B{3a}ser, have you
unsealed the blade?{end}

Ah ... Hah hah ... Incredible.
Truly the sword of legend.{end}

What terrifying power ...
I understand
why demons revere it.{end}

I don't believe this ...
That light from the sword,
it's blinding.{06}{07}
I can feel the power from here.
And that noise ...!
Damn! It won't stop!{end}

So, you've finally come ...{end}

Who's there?{end}

I see you've unsealed
the sword for us.{06}{07}
The Empire thanks you.
As you die, take
comfort in your service.{end}

Kaiser Bernhardt ...?{end}

What!? How?{end}

Didn't we already knock
over that wind bag?{end}

Heh heh heh ...
It seems you've met
my doppelg{38}nger.{06}{07}
Quite a spell.{end}

Hah hah hah ...{06}{07}
I remember when you
Imperial scum buckets were
so eager to join me.{06}{07}
Now you'll finally
taste what you
so desperately wanted.{06}{07}
Alhazard will rend
your hides and spill your
worthless guts.{end}

Really, you think so?
I see things differently.{06}{07}
You know, I think
the ritual has taxed
you considerably.{06}{07}
And I suspect you're
weak as a kitten.{end}

Wh, what is this!?
No ...!{end}

L, Langrisser's light ...
what's happening!?{end}

What the hell ...?
Is Langrisser ...
unsealing itself!?{end}

It must have responded
to Alhazard's resurrection ...{06}{07}
But this isn't in the legends.
Why would it do that now ...?{end}

Leon, you are fond of
that sword, are you not?
I think it suits us well.{06}{07}
While we're here, why
don't you take it for our
Imperial storehouse?{end}

The Empire is
as arrogant as ever.{06}{07}
You think you can take it?
You are welcome to try.{end}

B{3a}ser is worn out from
his big ceremonial moment.{06}{07}
This presents an opportunity.
We could take the
quacking bastard out for good.{06}{07}
We can take him out
with the Imperials.
Neither stands any chance.{end}

We can't let the Empire
lay their wretched
hands on Langrisser.{06}{07}
On the other hand,
B{3a}ser is a wreck
from that ancient ritual.{06}{07}
Now we can work with
the Empire and finish him.
What do you say?{end}

Will you turn against B{3a}ser?{end}

We don't want to antagonise
the Demon Tribe until they
outlive their usefulness ...{06}{07}
All forces, turn your blades
on the Imperial Army!{end}

Units, strike the Imperials!{end}

Hey {02},
Esto and Osto aren't
truly evil monsters!{06}{07}
I think they'll help
us if we can defeat B{3a}ser.{end}

I see.
So you think B{3a}ser is
controlling them?{end}

We must give it our all.
Smash the Empire to bits!{end}

A torn chain has dropped
from above the magic symbol.{06}{07}

Will you pick it up?{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{06}{07}

The item above the
other magic symbol vanished.{end}

A rusty metal plate has
dropped from the magic symbol.{06}{07}

Will you pick it up?{end}

The rust cleared, revealing the
form of a magnificent shield.{end}

Obtained Odin's Buckler.{06}{07}

The item above the other
magic symbol vanished.{end}

Neither Bernhardt or B{3a}ser
will stand against me!{06}{07}
Langrisser and Alhazard,
with you as my tools, ...
I will bring an era of order!{end}

Would making an enemy
of B{3a}ser do me any good?{end}

Uugghh ...
How could we let Langrisser ...
fall to the Empire ...{end}

No need to worry,
please die instead.{06}{07}
Langrisser will be quite
useful to my Empire.
Hah hah hah hah hah!{end}

Forgive me!
It's hopeless now ...{end}

We messed up!{end}

Ooh, little girl.
Are you pointing that
sword at me?{06}{07}
A traitor's blood is
always delicious ...
Your father's, especially.{end}

You bastard!
I'll never forgive you!{end}

Uugghhh--! I'm finished...{end}

{font3}We will remember
{font3}this day!{end}

{font3}Grrrr--!
{font3}So much ... pain!{end}

So you turn against me?
Hah hah hah ... May your
pain equal your stupidity.{06}{07}
Alhazard will
shred your slimy pink skin.{end}

Traitors, die.
Alhazard will drink
your damned souls!{end}

All of you must die.
Humans have no place here!{end}

You Imperials came so close.
Searching out Alhazard,
playing your little game.{06}{07}
Now, for all your hard work,
you'll die by the same weapon!{end}

D, damn you!
I didn't think you had
this much power ...{06}{07}
This world ...
into darkness ...
Velzeria's ... people ...{end}

Obtained Alhazard.{end}

Esto joins the entourage!{end}

Osto joins the entourage!{end}

Heh heh ... That ritual ...
The pain's sticking with me.{06}{07}
I can't exert my true
power like this ...
But just a little longer ...{06}{07}
{02}, take care
of these matters, and you
will be well rewarded.{end}

Yes, ...
Leave it to me.{end}

Please ...{end}

Long live the Kaiser!
Long live the Empire!{end}

Ugh--aarrgghh!{end}

{font3}Ugh ...{end}

{font3}Arrgh ...{end}

{font3}Aaah--!{end}

Young fool, what are
you waiting for?
Hand over Alhazard.{end}

If you think you
can take it, then by all
means, try your best.{end}

Interesting. Know this, boy!
The Empire crushes
all who oppose its vision!{end}

So you wretches sold
your souls to darkness.{06}{07}
This continent does not need
your leadership. We'll destroy
you on our path to glory!{end}

Aaarrgghhh ...
It was a mistake to
follow you here ...{end}

You were not chosen to
rule this continent.{06}{07}
Your Empire ends
here, with you,
you withered old man.{end}

Aaarghhh--!
Damn you!
It can't end like this!{end}

Now you see how
limited and pathetic
humans truly are!{end}

This is the power of 
Langrisser and Alhazard!
Do you understand!?{end}

You underestimate me ...
But for now, let us retreat.{end}

I have ensured
Alhazard's safety.{end}

Ugh ... Uugghh!{end}

Yes, Master B{3a}ser ...{06}{07}
Alhazard ... has it
been unlocked?{end}

Wh, what are you saying!?
The Dark Blade's energy ...
Can it truly be released ...?{end}

Liana ...{end}

Such incredible power!{end}

No ... Aaahhh ...!
This world will
be drenched in misery!{end}

By the way B{3a}ser,
what will you
do with Liana now?{06}{07}
Surely you don't intend ...{end}

Aaahhh--!{end}

Liana!{end}

Don't worry, {02}.{06}{07}
B{3a}ser and Sister ...
By acquiring their power,
I may redeem myself.{end}

...!?{end}

Yes!{end}

We'll help too!{end}

Of course, Sister.{end}

Let's go, everyone!
We must continue to push
back the Empire!{end}

Die, monster!
You don't belong in this world!{end}

Grrr ... Arrgghh!
These are truly the
swords of legend ...!{06}{07}
For now, ...
we must retreat.{end}

So you've betrayed
the Descendants, the Empire,
and the forces of darkness?{06}{07}
You've got more balls
than I thought, boy. Anyone
but you would be long dead.{06}{07}
Unfortunately, we alone
will take final victory!
En garde, {02}!{end}

You're with the right crowd,
{02}. Demons and
scoundrels flock together.{06}{07}
I suppose you've just wanted
supreme tyranny all along,
like a little puppeteer.{06}{07}
I hope your blood matches
the rust on my hilt.{end}

Arrghh--! How could ...{end}

Grr ...! Not yet!
No, I can't be beaten!{end}

Don't be reckless, Laird.
The Empire cannot afford
to lose its finest colonel.{06}{07}
Fall back with my blessing.{end}

Hah ...!{end}

Grr--!
It's hopeless now ...{end}

How can they
have so much power ...?{end}

How could I ...? Ugh ...{end}

Hah hah hah!{06}{07}
How can this be?
We've grown so ridiculously,
ridiculously ... powerful!{06}{07}
We've crushed the Imperials,
shattered the Descendants,
and torn B{3a}ser to shreds.{06}{07}
And our reward ...?
Not one, but both legendary
swords. Unbelievable!{end}

We did it, {02}!{end}

Aren't you quite
the big shot, {02}?
Hah hah hah.{end}

Now we can create
an ideal society.{end}

Ugh ... uugghh!{end}

Th, this place is ...?
Huh, Liana?
Are you okay, Liana?{end}

Now that we've defeated B{3a}ser,
his control over the
maidens should soon dissipate.{end}

With B{3a}ser defeated,
shouldn't his mind control
wear off soon?{end}

Sister L{37}na ...
Why am I ...?
Al, Alhazard?{end}

Alhazard is here.
B{3a}ser is already dead.{end}

We've defeated him!{end}

Both of you, listen.{06}{07}
Langrisser and Alhazard,
the holy and dark blades ...
They are both in my hands.{06}{07}
With these tools, not a
soul in this world
can stand against me.{06}{07}
And soon, I will bring some
well-deserved peace and order
to this shattered continent.{06}{07}
Even humans and demons
may live together in harmony.{06}{07}
But to realize this vision,
I need your cooperation.{end}

Yes, let's work together!
It's meaningless for humans
and demons to wage war.{06}{07}
A world where we can all
live together in peace would
be the most wonderful thing.{end}

But really, {02} ...
Do you think, after all this,
force can bring peace?{end}

You may preserve
order with an iron grip, but
as soon as it weakens ...{06}{07}
What happens then?{end}

By that time, the people must
have faith in this
new world they live in.{end}

{02}, we must
always move forward!
Our goal is peace!{end}

Come on, {02} ...
You can understand what
we mean, right?{end}

...{06}{07}
Leave.{end}

{02} ...{end}

Wh, what ...!?{end}

After I have come so far ...
After I have fought so hard ...{06}{07}
All of it, all of it
to keep my promise ...
To create the world we
both dream of ...{06}{07}
And you are asking me,
when I finally have the power
to make a real difference,
to just walk away!?{06}{07}
I am bringing peace to
this continent and ending
its wars--my way.{06}{07}
There will be no more
children left as orphans,
crying over their parents'
bloody bodies.{06}{07}
If anyone could have
understood, I thought would
have been you, Liana ...{end}

{02} ...{end}

...{end}

Let's go, Liana ...{end}

{02} ...{end}

Hey, {02} ...
You were a little hard
on her, don't you think?{06}{07}
Liana isn't a bad girl,
and what she wants isn't
really so different ...{end}

...
She can go her own way ...
It's not our problem.{06}{07}
For now, let's focus on
dismantling the Empire.{end}

...
Forget about her ...{06}{07}
For now, let's focus on
dismantling the Empire.{end}

Of course!{06}{07}
If we let them go, they
will surely rally their forces.{end}

If we depart now, 
we can still catch them.{end}

Let's go, everyone.
Let's catch
the Empire by its tail!{end}

{font3}Uugghh ...?
{font3}This place is ...
{font3}what is it ...?{end}

Can you hear me?
B{3a}ser's spell has broken.{06}{07}
Right now, I'm fighting
for a world where humans and
monsters will live peacefully.{06}{07}
Please, please,
lend us your power!{end}

{font3}...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Yes, we understand.
{font3}We will make
{font3}ourselves useful.{end}

Dark Princess, with your
help, the Glory of Darkness
has been restored.{06}{07}
You have my
sincerest appreciation.{end}

Maiden of Light,
I must thank you for this
delicious sensation.{06}{07}
Alhazard unsealed
at long last.
Hah ... Hah hah hah hah!{end}

Don't worry yourself,
I have no reason to kill her.{06}{07}
In truth, she may
still be of use to us ...{06}{07}
{font4}Dithum Aynde
{font4}Kaotik Deorc
{font4}On Kantrelu!{end}

Heh heh heh ...
This is quite fitting.{06}{07}
With the Imperial Army's
disgraceful failure, their
remaining forces will disband.{end}

We will take this
opportunity to finish things.{06}{07}
We shall hunt down the 
Imperial stragglers
and annihilate them!{06}{07}
Also, Hein, Rohga, listen to me!
We have no reason
to pay B{3a}ser any heed.{06}{07}
If we defeat him swiftly,
Alhazard will fall to us!{end}

What!?{end}

I'll give you one chance
to return to B{3a}ser!{06}{07}
Otherwise, from
here on, we are enemies.{end}

Hey now, Sonya!
I'd rather not fight you ...
How about joining us?{end}

Is Brother telling me
to betray Master B{3a}ser!?{end}

When we obtain
Alhazard, humans and monsters
may be able to co-exist.{06}{07}
B{3a}ser only wants a world
for monsters, while the Empire
only a world for humans.{06}{07}
However, we have the
ability to establish
a world where both can live.{06}{07}
Don't you think
that's the best solution?{end}

I want to live with
brother Rohga too.
But B{3a}ser's power is ...{end}

Don't worry. We're going to
gut his Royal Dark One's ass.{06}{07}
The people who tie
you up aren't touching
my little sister without
losing their heads.{end}

...{06}{07}
I understand ...
I will try to
battle with brother!{end}

{font3}Sonya,
{font3}are you betraying us!?{end}

{font3}Kill traitors!{end}

Esto leaves the entourage ...{end}

Osto leaves the entourage ...{end}

Betraying me is a quick
road to a painful death.{06}{07}
But it's not all bad.
I shall enjoy watching
you writhe in agony.{06}{07}
My minions,
rip them to shreds!{end}

Don't be absurd!
Do you plan on fighting with
a tiny force like that?{end}

Yes ... Now witness
the fury of Alhazard!{06}{07}
Hah hah hah!
Forward, my minions!{end}
