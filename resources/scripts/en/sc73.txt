Your Highness, does
everything go as planned?{end}

Yes, don't concern yourself.
No one will find
us in this wilderness.{end}

Shouldn't His Majesty
rest for a little while?{end}

Hah!
Wounds like these won't
fell your Kaiser.{06}{07}
Our troops have momentum.
Let them keep it.{end}

But, Your Majesty ...{end}

What!? We're being followed?
It, It's {02}!{end}

Damn! They move quickly ...{end}

You won't escape so easily,
Kaiser of Rayguard.{end}

Ah, it's the annoying little brat!
I see you're eager to die.{end}

I'll remain and hold them.
The rest of you, honour
your duty to His Majesty.{end}

Leon, please see to
His Majesty's care.{end}

I understand, General Vargas.
You are brave beyond words!{end}

Looks like we're facing the
Flaming Fag Brigade or
whatever they call themselves.{end}

If we take too much time,
we'll lose the main force.{end}

All right, let's strike quickly.
Our target is General Vargas!{end}

Come on then,
red-haired brat!{06}{07}
I'll show you the power of the
Imperial Blazing Dragon Army's
most elite forces!{end}

The Empire doesn't take
kindly to its generals' deaths.{06}{07}
I, for Vargas, will command
this guard and butcher you all.{end}

Not so fast.
Our priority should be
His Majesty's safety.{end}

Hold off for now,
and don't lose your head.{06}{07}
We must protect
His Majesty until his escape.{end}

Just a bit longer ...
If we can buy ourselves
a little more time, then ...{end}

Just a bit longer ...
And His Majesty's
safety is assured ...{end}

Watch out, {02}.
At this rate, we're going
to lose the Kaiser!{end}

{02}!
You're taking far too long!
Are you letting hm go!?{end}

Don't you see, {02}!?
If you take too much time,
you'll lose sight of the Kaiser!{end}

This is getting critical ...
Don't waste your time on trash!
Focus on their commanders!{end}

Oh, our fun
is over too soon.
Bye bye, boys!{end}

Gwah hah hah!
His Majesty is over the horizon!
You'll never find him now.{06}{07}
Mission complete!
Time to withdraw.{end}

Grrr ...
We took too long ...{end}

They've crossed the bridge!
Your Majesty, please hurry!{end}

They've breached the bridge!
Your Highness, quickly!{end}

Hmmm ...{end}

Bastards ...!{06}{07}
If I don't rest soon, I'll ...
I may not survive ...{end}

Brat!
If you come any further,
don't think you'll live.{end}

Are you all
right, Vargas?{06}{07}
I wouldn't ask if it
were anyone but {02}
you just dealt with.{end}

{02}'s a damn coward.
Worry about something else.{end}

Fine, but don't be reckless.
I prefer fighting to running
myself, but duty is duty.{end}

I apologise.{end}

Don't thank me!{end}

Looks like he's
sticking around until
Imelda gets out.{end}

So it's Vargas and Imelda ...
Good times.{end}

It's won't be a problem.
Langrisser's right here!{end}

Some dirty mice are playing
with a small stone.{06}{07}

Will you drive them away?{end}

The dirty mice run away,
leaving the small stone.{06}{07}

As you pick up the stone,
it begins to shine ...{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

The dirty mice continue to play
with the stone and take it away.{end}

Out of the way!
We have no time for
this nonsense!{end}

I, I didn't plan this ...{end}

Why ...?{end}

Damn kids!{end}

And we came all
this way, too ...{end}

Uugghh, I've been ...
defeated ...!{end}

{font3}Arrrrghh--!
This host ... too weak ...{end}

Forgive me, Vargas.
I leave everything in your care.{end}

Leave it to me.{end}

Forgive me, Imelda.
I leave everything in your care.{end}

Don't worry.{end}

Forgive me ...
I leave everything in your care.{end}

Please stay safe.
I'll catch up with you after
I deal with these guys.{end}

There's no need to worry,
Your Majesty.{06}{07}
For the honour of the
Water Dragon Navy,
we won't leave a man alive.{end}

I'll be waiting.{end}

Ugh! These damned
old wounds ...{end}

It's His Majesty ...!
Quickly, get him to safety.{end}

His Highness needs a healer!
Please, get him to safety!{end}

Your Highness, this way ...{end}

Leon, take care
of His Majesty.{end}

Leon, take care
of His Majesty.{end}

Leave it to me.
I will protect him
with my life.{end}

Go ahead, Leon.
Secure a path
for His Highness!{end}

Go ahead, Leon.
Secure a path
for His Highness!{end}

Don't worry,
I will do just that.{06}{07}
Fight well and take
care of the rest.{end}

You made it here, but
luck doesn't hold forever.{06}{07}
This time,
we will not lose!{end}

You won't go any further!{end}

Hmmm ...{06}{07}
Vargas, can you
control this situation?{end}

Yeah, just leave it to me.
Now get moving!{end}

Hmmm ...{06}{07}
Imelda, you handle
matters here.{end}

Leave it to me.
Just get out of here.{end}

General Vargas,
we pray for
your good fortune!{end}

Yeah, thanks.
Take care of His Majesty.{end}

General Imelda,
we pray for
your good fortune!{end}

They don't know who they're
dealing with.
Just see to His Majesty.{end}

Ugh, damn it!{end}

Laird, this way ...{end}

You'd better look out, brat!
This time, I'm getting
you back for Zorum's death!{end}

You'd better look out, punk!
This time, I won't hold back!{end}

Aaaaaahhh--!
Blazing Dragons, charge!{end}

Punks, prepare yourselves!{end}

Ugh, im, impossible ...
I, I am General Vargas ... of
the Blazing Dragon Army.{06}{07}
Ugghhh ...
Please look after ...
Eliza and ... Emilia ...{end}

Vargas ...! How could
you be so careless ...
Damn it all!{end}

I won't let you get pass.
Meet me with your swords!{end}

The General has been defeated?
Let us join with Imelda
and avenge General Vargas!{end}

Vargas, you fought splendidly.
Your death shall not be wasted,
I promise you, old friend.{end}

Sorry ...{end}

I'll never forget you guys ...{end}

Well, Vargas, I'll
punish those
bastards for you!{end}

Let's offer them support!{end}

All right!
I'm going too.{end}

Y, yes!{end}

Get ready, bastards.
I shall avenge Vargas' death!{end}

All right!
Time to go!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Stubborn bastards!
Let's fight back!{end}

Come now, and
meet your punishment.{end}

Don't run or we'll cut you down.
Prepare to fight.{end}

Imelda!{end}

Forgive me ...
Vargas ... I am not ...
fit to be a General ...{end}

I'll take revenge for you.
Rest in peace, Imelda.{end}

Aaaahhh ...{end}

I, Imelda!{end}

I won't allow this, bastards!
I'll make you pay!{end}

Aaaahhh--! No ...
An injury like this ...
I'm dead ... I ...{06}{07}
Everyone, take care ...
of His Majesty ...{end}

Imelda, you fought well.
It was a fitting battle
for a Heavenly Dragon.{06}{07}
We'll make sure your
actions bring great result.{end}

I'm sorry ...{end}

I'll never forget you guys ...{end}

He hasn't died yet.{end}

Protect His Majesty
at all costs!{end}

Since you established this
Empire with His Highness,
I vowed to see its protection.{06}{07}
They'll get here one
way or another ...{end}

Hmph, its nice to know
we have such valiant
supporters. Take care.{end}

D, damn these wounds ...
How can I succumb to them?{06}{07}
Next time we meet
shall be your last!{end}

We must remain mobile
and focus on
their vulnerabilities.{end}

Please!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

If you want to go on,
you'll have to defeat me first!{end}

How could I lose ...{end}

Even if my body's cut to
ribbons, you will not pass!{end}

I must not let them
reach His Majesty ...{end}

I'll make you suffer
a most painful death ...{end}

Ugh, no good ...{end}

That's it!
Kill them all!{end}

Long live the Kaiser!
Long live the Empire!{end}

What persistence ...
I honestly didn't think
you'd make it to me.{end}

I did it ...{end}

My swordsmanship ...
could use some work ...{end}

So, I'm the last one left.
I'm not giving in.
Don't even think it.{06}{07}
I'll get His Majesty and
his troops whatever time and
distance they need.{06}{07}
Now then, red-haired punk.
Stop your gawking
and let us cross blades!{end}

So you've chased us this far ...
You have endurance, all right.{end}

Hah hah hah hah hah!
Everyone is down but me!
I must be the belle of the ball.{06}{07}
But don't worry, boys.
I'm not going to run away.{end}

Why not? Why be
so persistent?{end}

Generals have standards, kid.
They are what give
us the right to command.{06}{07}
If I show weakness
even once, it's all over.{06}{07}
And for a
woman, that goes double.{end}

Worrying about such
trifles will only stress you.{end}

I'm happy right now
for one thing ...
I don't need to show off.{end}

...{end}

Well, the final battle's ahead.
Shall we move onward?{end}

Vargas has been defeated!
Join Imelda and take revenge!{end}

We must pursue their
main force or we'll lose them!{end}

Probably Castle Velzeria ...{end}

Farewell, Heavenly Dragons.
General Vargas ...
General Imelda ...{end}

That was the last of the
Rayguard Empire's
Army and Navy, it seems.{end}

Vargas and Imelda ...
competent and loyal
warriors to the very end.{end}

That's right.
If they escaped there ...{end}

Getting through the defences
in Castle Velzeria
could be problematic.{06}{07}
We must strike quickly,
before they can
ready themselves.{end}
