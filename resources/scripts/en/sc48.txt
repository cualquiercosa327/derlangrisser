Somehow, we're
still ahead of them.{end}

The soldiers are
in formation, Princess!{end}

Great.
Keep me updated.{end}

I'm surprised everything
went so smoothly ...{06}{07}
We're ready and
willing to engage the
enemy, Cherie.{end}

Excellent. I'm happy
things went well.
And sorry I'm late ...{06}{07}
If it weren't for
Liana's management, we'd
still be forming up.{end}

Cherie, don't
be so modest!{06}{07}
Without your instructions,
I'd have been totally lost!{end}

It seems the Princess
has finally become a
seasoned tactician.{06}{07}
You'd never know she used to
sneak off whenever I assigned
her to study war history ...{end}

Keith!
Stop ruining my image!{end}

{02} ...?{end}

So, the Empire has
finally made its move.{06}{07}
Troops, move into position!{end}

...{end}

Just a little further, and
it's back to Rayguard.
I'll buy everyone a round ...{end}

When His Majesty holds
Langrisser, victory
will be all but ours.{06}{07}
Any opposition would
crumble before
such a weapon ...{end}

If we deliver the sword,
everyone will soon
be at peace, right?{end}

Yes, that's true, Hein.{06}{07}
The nations of this world
won't know peace until
the Empire brings it to them.{06}{07}
Very soon now, this
continent will be
one of quiet order.{end}

Not if I can help it!{end}

Hmph!
How bothersome ...{end}

Your goal is
so naive ...{06}{07}
For there to be
true peace, there must
be mutual trust.{end}

Yes, what a beautiful
fantasy that is ...{06}{07}
Sadly, we live in an
imperfect world.{06}{07}
The way to peace
is through enforcement,
through the might and justice
of one grand Empire!{end}

Yes, we will stitch
this tattered world
back together.{06}{07}
You see ...
Now, we have both blades--
Langrisser and Alhazard.{06}{07}
Against their power,
all opposition will join or
surrender. War will end.{06}{07}
Bernhardt's ideal, his vision ...
Our power will build it step
by step, blow by blow.{end}

I think not.{06}{07}
Alhazard and the Empire ...
Nothing good can come of them.
Darkness can't bring light,
and evil can't bring peace!{end}

Yes, and you
hope for peace while
waging a futile war!{06}{07}
Peace will come easily
if you simply give up.{end}

As I thought, we
can't make you
understand our position.{end}

It's bad enough that
the Kaiser has the
Dark Blade, Alhazard ...{06}{07}
If he also obtains
Langrisser, we'll be
in deep trouble.{06}{07}
Block them from the
Imperial Capital by
any means necessary!{end}

So, you're still
in our way?{06}{07}
We'll just have to
go through you, then.{end}

{02} ...
Why must you
fight us?{end}

I'm fighting for the only
legitimate reason.
I want to bring peace.{06}{07}
I wouldn't fight you,
Liana, if I didn't have to ...{end}

Aaahh ... {02} ...
Why do we meet in battle when
we have the same wish?{end}

Liana ...{end}

Trying to talk things out
never solves anything.{end}

A first rate manoeuvre,
using the girl
against {02} like that!{end}

We've got to win
here, or we'll never
retake Langrisser.{06}{07}
Cast aside all other concerns.
We must fight as
one to the very end!{end}

There ... won't be
a second chance.{end}

As I thought, {02}, you
are a decent warrior. But to
defeat me will take far more.{end}

The Empire is a terrible
foe, indeed ... But
we can't turn back now.{end}

That's right.{06}{07}
If they get both Langrisser
and Alhazard ...
It ... It will be all over ...{end}

You cannot rely on those
swords to bring that "peace"
you keep referring to.{06}{07}
Sure, your goal may not
be to cause even more chaos,
but those two swords
were forged for war!{06}{07}
And war is exactly what
they will bring as long as they
remain on this continent.{end}

Fighting is not justified
for any reason.{06}{07}
But if you have to choose one,
fighting to stop a war ...
is the most appealing.
That's what we're doing here.{end}

Cast aside all else!
Fight with
everything you've got!{end}

{02} ...
How, how can I fight
against you ...?{end}

From the water's surface,
a spirit gazes with interest.{06}{07}

What will you do?{end}

Ignore it{end}

Smile{end}

Attack{end}

The water spirit
goes somewhere else.{end}

The spirit returns your smile
and gives you a sparkling robe.{end}

Obtained Wizard's Robe.{end}

The water spirit is
angered and leaves.{end}

Something shaped like a burial
mound is in the sand below.{06}{07}

Will you try and dig it out?{end}

Obtained Arbalest.{end}

A beautiful flower grows
from a crack in a rock.{06}{07}

Will you try and touch it?{end}

The flower wilted.{end}

"I am the spirit of the flower."{06}{07}

"Thank you, kind-hearted
human.
I will grant you one wish."{end}

Wish for knowledge{end}

Wish for strength{end}

I need nothing{end}

MP raised by 3 points.{end}

AT raised by 1 point.
DF raised by 1 point.{end}

"I see. Maybe we can
meet again somewhere ..."{06}{07}

The flower spirit left.{end}

Cherie, please don't do this.
I don't want to kill you.{end}

No! I won't give up!{06}{07}
If I defeat you,
we can take Langrisser ...
and stop this all!{end}

It sounds like you
have made up your mind ...
Prepare yourself, Cherie.{end}

I must defeat anyone
who gets in
my way, even Liana.{end}

Why!?
Why must we fight ...?{end}

I have to fight my family ...
I have to fight
my dearest friends ...{06}{07}
Such is war ... 
This is why
I must end it!{end}

Stop interfering!{end}

We cannot step aside!{end}

Impossible!
All that I've done ...{end}

Hein ...{06}{07}
Don't you want things
as they were,
like the good old days?{end}

Forgive me, Liana ...{end}

Ugghh--!
I'm finished!{end}

Please, step aside!{end}

Argh--!
Right in front of the
Imperial Capital ...{end}

You can't continue, Leon!{06}{07}
Leave the rest to us!{end}

Thank you ...{end}

Welcome to your funeral!
You can't stop us,
and you can't stop the future.{end}

How could this happen?{06}{07}
How could I lose
to this kind of punk!?{end}

Grrraahhh!
Blazing Dragon Army,
bash them down!{06}{07}
Skewer them on
our Imperial blades!
Gah hah hah!{end}

Ooohh--!
How could this happen ...!{end}

{02}, the
Imperial Capital
lies beyond.{06}{07}
No matter what,
you won't pass!{end}

Aahh ...
How could I ... have lost--{end}

Help, someone!
Escort Lady Jessica
to safety!{end}

We've no more time!
Let's go!
Show no mercy!{end}

You will not
have Langrisser!{end}

Uugghh--!
This can't be ...{end}

Princess, please retreat!{end}

But ...!{end}

Now is our chance
to end this!{06}{07}
They may have a
skilled commander, but we
know the terrain!{end}

Understood ...
Sorry I've troubled you ...{end}

We weren't strong enough ...{06}{07}
{02}, I will
not forget this day.{end}

Time to go!{end}

Block off their path
to the Imperial Capital!{end}

Argh ...
This is it ...{end}

...{06}{07}
{02} ...
You and I share the same
hatred for war.{06}{07}
Why are we made to
battle one another ...?{06}{07}
I ... I do not know ...{06}{07}
But I cannot overlook
the danger that Alhazard
poses to this world!{end}

If only things were so simple.
We might place all
the blame on war alone ...{06}{07}
No, there's more
to it than that.{06}{07}
Our difference in perspective
compels us to fight.{end}

Aaahh--!{end}

Liana!?{end}

Why have you changed,
{02} ...{06}{07}
I, I ...{end}

I don't want to
fight you, Liana!{06}{07}
I know you don't
agree with me, but
we don't have to kill
each other over it!{06}{07}
I beg you, don't come to
another battlefield.{06}{07}
Wait ... Wait somewhere
safe for this war to end.
You deserve to live ...{end}

...{06}{07}
I can't do that, {02}.{06}{07}
It breaks my heart
to fight you, but
I won't run away.{06}{07}
Everywhere I look, I see
pain and sadness ... The Empire
isn't a solution to that.{06}{07}
{02} ...
Cast away any lingering doubts.
From now on, we are enemies.{end}

Liana ...
Our ideals are important
to both of us ...{end}

All units, charge!{end}

So I'm dying, am I ...
Hah hah ... How ... strange ...
Ugh-- arrghh ...{end}

I, I wasn't prepared for
you to be this strong ...{end}

Langrisser ...
Langrisser can really
do that ...?{end}

Ooohhh--!{end}

No one can
hope to match me!{end}

I, I lost ...{end}

Magnificent ...
The Empire is
most impressive ...{end}

Th, that sword ...{end}

Fight using every
ounce of your strength!{06}{07}
Go, now!{end}

Ugh ...{end}

Ugh--!
I won't falter even in
the face of death!{end}

Behold the power
of the Kalxath
Aerial Knights!{end}

You think you can
beat me? Hah hah ...
How completely pathetic.{end}

Sorry, Liana ...{end}

{02} ...{end}

You're much too naive.{06}{07}
Children can't survive
on the battlefield, you know.{end}

Maybe you're right.{06}{07}
But compassion comes
naturally to humans.
It's not weak, it's who we are.{06}{07}
Why do you
turn from it?{end}

We don't.{06}{07}
If we abandoned our hearts,
we would be worthless,
bloodthirsty marauders.{06}{07}
I agree, war is horrible.
If it were gone
forever, few would miss it.{06}{07}
With Rayguard comes order,
with order comes peace.
They refuse to see this ...{end}

We will quickly
rid the world of war.{end}

I am resolved to this
course of action.{06}{07}
Because no one else
can achieve this goal
faster than we can.{end}

I see ...{06}{07}
Well, let's head to the
Imperial Capital.
His Majesty is waiting.{end}

In spite of the time
and effort involved,
we've no other choice.{06}{07}
All right, everyone, let's
head to the Imperial Capital!{end}

Well, we've no time to waste.
We'll reach the
Imperial Capital soon ...{end}

Wonderful, you've
returned safely.
Your duty is complete.{end}

Indeed!{end}

Your praise is more
than we deserve ...{end}

We will gladly
endure any trouble for
His Majesty's benefit.{end}

So this is {02}.
I have heard of you.{06}{07}
I understand you were
a major factor in the
fulfilment of this mission.{06}{07}
Please continue to work
hard for our Empire.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Very soon, we
will launch a swift attack
from Rayguard.{end}

At last, the Empire
has both swords.{06}{07}
Because of that,
we will fear nothing.
Steadily, our invasion
will commence.{06}{07}
And so we take our first
steps toward unity ...{end}

For this stratagem,
you may count
on my assistance.{end}

Even Lord Egbert?{end}

That's right.{06}{07}
Though we've come far,
failure is not permissible.{end}

And the first target?{end}

The target is Salrath.{06}{07}
Each of you, hurry on
and prepare your men.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

I shall return
bearing good tidings
of our victory.{end}

{02}.
I entrust this operation
to your command.{end}

To me?{end}

This is at Egbert's suggestion.
Your lead gives us
our greatest advantage.{06}{07}
Langrisser will lie
in your hands, for no
others can wield it.{end}

Understood.
I shall do my best, for the
sake of continental unity.{end}

Very good.
I look forward to your
labour's fruition.{end}

Just leave it
to me, Your Majesty.{end}

I swear to make
Your Majesty's
dream a reality!{end}

Use force as needed.
Make each nation
understand our might!{06}{07}
Remember, we strike to
quell all resistance--
both present and future.{end}

Sir, yes Sir!
Now, I ask your leave.{end}

Ah, it seems my predictions
were not mistaken.{06}{07}
With Your Majesty's
support, I believe we will
bring peace and end
darkness on this continent.{end}

I'll trust your judgement
with regard to demons.
And so, if you don't mind?{end}

As you wish ...{end}

Egbert joins the entourage!{end}

Heh heh heh ...{06}{07}
Time to see if this withering
husk of flesh is still
worthy of the battlefield.{06}{07}
Hmph!{end}

It seems that I'm
the only one left ...{06}{07}
Everyone else has
turned tail and fled.{06}{07}
But you'll find I'm different.
I'll fight to the very end!{end}

So I'm the only
one left after all ...{06}{07}
But your group
must be worn out!
As long as I can,
I'll keep trying!{06}{07}
The Sword of Light
will be returned!{end}

{02}.{06}{07}
My force is
the only one left ...{06}{07}
But, I didn't come here
just to give up!
Here I come, {02}!{end}

I had hoped to
do more than this ...{end}

Even though we're alone,
I'll fight to the finish!{end}

Princess, you did your best.
You need to keep
your cool if you want to win.{end}

I know!{end}

Aahhh ...{06}{07}
Why did things
turn out like this?{06}{07}
How can you keep living
with so much blood
on your hands, {02} ...{end}
