I understand the situation.
But ... is sealing Langrisser
the right thing to do?{end}

B{3a}ser has been defeated--
Alhazard lies in human hands.{06}{07}
I can't foresee Langrisser
Being any use to us now ...{06}{07}
Sieghart forged
the Holy Blade to combat
Alhazard. The best choice
would seal them both.{end}

...{end}

What's wrong, Liana?{end}

Ah ... {06}{07}
Nothing, really.
Nothing at all.{end}

It's hard, isn't it, Liana?
Having to fight him ...{end}

...{06}{07}
You need not fight
him against your will.{06}{07}
If you wish to
return to {02}'s side,
I won't stop you ...{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
You are a Descendant of Light.
Why have you chosen
to do all you've done ...? {06}{07}
Lady Jessica,
why has {02} ...?{end}

Perhaps Lushiris knows.
What's your opinion, Goddess?{end}

The role of the Descendant
exists to repel darkness.
This is its ordained purpose.{06}{07}
Humans may combat darkness
without aid, but this
requires tremendous will.{06}{07}
{02} may stray from
destiny to prove to us what
a lone human can do.{end}

Lushiris ...{end}

I, too, wish to
carry out my duty as
the Maiden of Light. {06}{07}
But I just can't ...
I can't fight him like this.
That's why ...{end}

...{end}

That's why I want
you to erase my memories! {06}{07}
I wish to forget ...,
I wish to forget {02}!{end}

Liana ...{end}

Oh, god of time, knowledge,
and mercy! Wipe her mind
clean of strife and sadness.{06}{07}
{font4}La Halig Leoht ...
Claensian Sinre Gemynd!{end}

What ...?
What am I doing here ...?{end}

Liana ...
You went that far ...? {end}

Well, the spell
seems to have worked.{end}

This is ...
the celestial realm?{end}

We have outdone ourselves.
How many mortals can say
they have visited the gods?{end}

That's ... That's Lushiris ...!
The Goddess of Light!{end}

Ah, Liana is here too.{end}

Too late ...
If only the sealing was
a little faster.{end}

You won't be sealing anything.{06}{07}
I am uniting this
continent, and every bit of
opposition has failed.{06}{07}
Are you going
to try your luck?{end}

Please step back, Lushiris.
We can take care of them!{end}

...{06}{07}
Very well.{end}

All units, move into position!
Prepare to intercept!{end}

How dare you desecrate
Lushiris' haven!
I won't allow this!{end}

You won't pollute
Lushiris' holy ground!{end}

I respect your decision, ...
but I will not allow you to die.{end}

Wait, Lushiris!{end}

Do not worry.
I must test their strength.{end}

Slumbering hero who
lies within my memory, I call
upon your might ...!{06}{07}
{font4}Wreccan Fram Thin Slaepe,
Hatte The Lifde, Ledin!{end}

Ledin, King of Baldea.
I bid you welcome.{end}

"Ledin" alone is fine.
It has been ages since last
we met, Jessica.{end}

How many centuries have
passed since we liberated
El Sallia from the darkness?{06}{07}
Oh, Jessica, I see some
things never change.
You look as beautiful as ever.{end}

That voice ...!{06}{07}
King Sieghart ...
Wasn't your soul bound
within Langrisser ...?{end}

Naturally, he
isn't the true prince
you once served.{06}{07}
He is but shadows and dust
conjured from my
infinite memory of this world.{06}{07}
I think, however, you shall
find my memory is quite good.{end}

So, this time, even the
Goddess of Light herself
has gotten involved.{06}{07}
Don't worry, I don't mind.{06}{07}
I am this world's supreme
champion, and, after this,
all will know it!{end}

{02}, do as you will.
Come at me with all you have.{end}

Liana, will you come with us?
What do you say?{end}

Who are you?
How do you know me?{end}

Wh, what ...?
Liana ...{06}{07}
What's wrong?
Surely you recognise me?{end}

No ... I only
recognise that you are
an enemy of Lushiris!{end}

This is it, your last chance.
It's not too late to surrender.{end}

I'm an old-fashioned woman.
I finish what I start.{end}

Why can't you understand!?{end}

Leon ...,
did you kill him?{end}

Yes.{06}{07}
No matter the odds, he
refused to capitulate.
He met a glorious end.{end}

He was so kind ...
How could you ...!{end}

Well, first off, the guy just
wouldn't stay dead no
matter how often we killed him.{06}{07}
Second, he refused surrender
about two dozen times.
I kept killing a few more
of his men and asking again.{06}{07}
...{06}{07}
I'm just messing with you.
He is alive but
severely injured.{06}{07}
You are lucky he's such an
extraordinary guy. Any
ordinary man would be dead
after what he has been through.{end}

Ah, ... thank goodness.
I can't allow my emotions to
get the better of me ...{end}

So, are you trying to
reclaim the sword's power?{end}

If you lose Langrisser,
you shall not rule this land.{end}

Don't bet on it.{06}{07}
You deities are all so
narrow-minded--pitting the
El Sallians against each other
in a continental chess game.{06}{07}
I may be fighting the
"Goddess of Light," but I
have much bigger plans in
store for this world.{06}{07}
I will cleanse the world of
the fragmentation, racism and
war that you, Chaos and your
kind have reigned on us!{end}

{02} ...
You flow with my blood.{end}

Wh, what did you say!?{end}

I'm your ancestor, {02}.
My blood flows within you.{06}{07}
{02} ...
Why have you abandoned your
role as my Descendant?{end}

I destroyed B{3a}ser
with my own strength.
The strength of will.{06}{07}
The Descendants of Light
no longer have any
place in our great world.{06}{07}
Humans are strong enough
to bring this world
peace without the
meddling deity you serve.{end}

A battle to
end all others ...{06}{07}
{02}, you and I once
shared the very same thoughts.{06}{07}
Jessica, Narm, Hawking,
Thorn, Albert, Lance ... Chris.
We fought B{3a}ser and sealed
away the darkness.{06}{07}
Afterwards, I took the throne
of Baldea and peace reigned
in the land for my lifetime.{06}{07}
But peace under a
leader ends with that leader.{06}{07}
You claimed Langrisser from
the ruins of my castle.
That throne once ruled over
the land you now try to unite.{06}{07}
You won't live
forever, and the peace
you create today will, in
the end, die with you.{end}

Ledin, what you
say is very true ...{06}{07}
I am but one man,
but if I can deliver the
world from chaos and terror
for even a short while ...{06}{07}
If it can even taste true peace,
then I will have done
better than any of these "gods."{end}

Are you the one responsible
for the Descendants inheriting
this worthless goddess' will!?{end}

Long ago, when I was a boy,
B{3a}ser took advantage of a
massive war amongst humans.{06}{07}
Like a virus, he assaulted us
when we were vulnerable
and at each other's
throats in intrigue and hate.{06}{07}
In order to stand a chance,
the people joined their hearts
and crafted a holy sword.{06}{07}
This weapon, Langrisser, had
the power to smash darkness,
but it required protection.{06}{07}
Throughout the ages, there
have been people who would
use the sword for their own
ends against fellow man.{06}{07}
The Descendants of Light
exist to see that these
men never lay their
hands on the holy blade.{end}

We already possess Alhazard!{06}{07}
With B{3a}ser dead and
Alhazard in the hands of
humans, the mission of the
Descendants has ended!{end}

Then show me your power.{06}{07}
I shall see if you have
the strength to bring
this peace you speak of.{end}

So you would
doubt my abilities ...?{end}

Why must we fight ...?{06}{07}
Back then, I wanted
you to teach me magic ...{end}

Hein, do you not see
how much your
ability has grown?{06}{07}
You no longer need a master.
Show me what you have learnt.{end}

I'd really rather
not fight you, Liana ...{end}

Why not ...?
How do you know me?{06}{07}
If I don't fight, I cannot
fulfil my role as a Descendant!{end}

You truly are the
spitting image of Liana!{end}

Oh well ...
I've never given any
leeway for looks.{end}

But keep your spirits up!{end}

Will we be okay ...?{06}{07}
You know, picking a fight
with a goddess ....
that's serious business.{end}

So you made your choice?
Well then, come at me!{end}

I never dreamt of battling
such legends!
And I'm not going to lose!{end}

I knew coming here
was going to be a mistake ...{end}

If you make it out alive,
I may tell you something!{end}

Crude scoundrel.{end}

I don't particularly
enjoy hurting women.{06}{07}
Why don't you just surrender?{end}

Why would I surrender!?
I will never capitulate!{end}

Probably ...{end}

Just surrender!
Leon would want you to!{end}

How dare you say that!
You ... You killed him!{end}

Leon ...
What happened to him?{end}

It's unfortunate, but I am
guessing that guy
is probably still alive.{06}{07}
That guy ...
He fought like a steel dragon.{end}

General Leon ...
you were so kind, even when
B{3a}ser controlled me ...{06}{07}
I will avenge you!{end}

I am certain he is hurt,
but he is not dead.{end}

Is that so?
Then I can fight without worry.{end}

Hah ... have I
really become this strong?{06}{07}
I am actually
battling a goddess.{end}

So, King of Baldea,
I just wanted to let you know,
we have your sword.{06}{07}
Langrisser is ours.{end}

Should I be afraid?
You cannot possibly
harness its power.{06}{07}
Langrisser can only be wielded
by a Descendants of Light
who has accepted his destiny!{end}

Shut up!{end}

Battling heroes of legend ...
What unthinkable opportunity!{end}

Come ...{end}

Damn it!
Is this the end for me!?
Damn it!{end}

You will die here!{end}

This is a chance
to stain my sword with
the blood of a god!{06}{07}
I wonder what colour
goddesses are on the inside?
Maybe blue?{06}{07}
Hmmm ... it's not as strange
an idea as I'd imagined.{end}

Aaaahhh--!
This is too much ...{end}

{font3}Even in god's dwelling,
we will not lose.{end}

{font3}Uuuggghhh--!{end}

{font3}I will use all
my strength!
For Sonya!{end}

{font3}T, this world
is different ...{end}

Lushiris ...
Was I wrong?{06}{07}
If the power of humans
has grown this strong, surely
their hearts can ...?{end}

...{06}{07}
Anything is possible.
It all depends on him ...{end}

Goddess ...
I have failed in my mission.{06}{07}
How was it ...
How was it I was blind to
the strength of humans ...{06}{07}
Theirs is the ability
to forge a new reality in the
flames of raw will ...{end}

That's right!
How could I give up!?
I definitely can't!{end}

We cannot allow
them any further!{end}

Stop it, Liana!{end}

A response is futile!{end}

Aaaahhh--!{end}

Are you okay!?
I'll treat you at once ...{end}

No ...,
Oh, {02} ...{06}{07}
{02}, this is ...
I'm sorry, but this time, ...
I, I'm dying.{06}{07}
Still ... I am so hap ...
happy that {02}'s
dream can come true.{06}{07}
I want you ... promise ...
Please promise me ...
You will bring lasting,
real peace to our world ...{end}

Liana ...
I promise you.{06}{07}
I swear it!{end}

Thank you ... 
I never wanted ... to fight ...
Never thought ... defeat ...{06}{07}
But I ...
Oh {02} ... I'm sorry.
I always loved you ...
{02} ...{06}{07}
Wanted us to ...
be ... tog--{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
Why ...
Why couldn't I ... have ...
be-- ... with you ...{end}

Have your memories returned?
Don't speak, Liana!
I'll tend to your wounds ...{end}

No ...,
Oh, {02} ...{06}{07}
{02}, this is ...
I'm sorry, but this time, ...
I, I'm dying.{06}{07}
For just a short ...
Hack! Cough ...
A short time we were ...
Could have ...{06}{07}
Good bye ...
my ... love ...
My {02} ...{end}

Liana, no!
Oh my ...! Please!{06}{07}
Liana!
Open your eyes, Liana!
You have to!{06}{07}
Liana, open your eyes!
If you can't ...
How can I show you the
new world we will create!?{end}

Sieghart's soul lies
bonded within Langrisser.{06}{07}
It is said to contain
unlimited power. However ...{end}

How dare you kill Leon!?
I won't let you
get away with it!{end}

Thank you ...
for sparing Leon.{end}

Don't thank us.
We don't know what's
still to come.{end}

For Leon!{end}

I, I abandon my duties as
a Descendant of Light!{end}

Why? You have no
reason to abandon them.{end}

I may have been your ally
under B{3a}ser's control,
but I am your enemy now!{end}

I'm fighting for humans
and demons to co-exist!{06}{07}
There is nothing wrong
with that dream, no matter
what anyone says!{end}

So this was my reward
for slaving under B{3a}ser ...
But now ...{end}

You did well to come this far.
I knew you were competent,
but to be present here ...{06}{07}
Well, enough contemplation.
Show me what humans can do.{end}

Taste my power!{end}

The Descendants of Light
have truly become useless.
Entrusting it to you ...{06}{07}
I, at least, shall be
the one to test your might!{end}

Aaaaahh--!{end}

H, how could you have ...
Wielding Langrisser ...?{06}{07}
{02}, I will tell
you something important.
Langrisser responds to the
heart of its wielder.{06}{07}
For you to have done
this ... It may be
possible that you can
realise your dreams.{06}{07}
However, young
Descendant of Baldea,
heed my words:{06}{07}
Power can destroy
what power obtains.{06}{07}
Some day, years in the future,
you will face a "{02}."
A young man with the
will to forge a new reality.{end}

Goddess of Light, I
understand your concern,
but all others failed.{06}{07}
The burden of bringing
peace to this shattered land
was born by I and I alone.{06}{07}
Not by any god, and
not by any man, both of who
sat idly while the land
tore itself apart.{06}{07}
I alone succeeded.{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
You have won.
You have defeated my and
everything I stood for.{06}{07}
This world is now left
in chaos. Unless you can
quell it, then your victory
has been truly empty.{06}{07}
Farewell, {02} ...{06}{07}
If I can help it ...
we will not see each
other again ...{end}

Liana ...{end}

Everyone, I will
create a new,
harmonious nation!{06}{07}
I ask you all,
will you continue to place
your faith in me?{end}

Thank you ...
Everyone, let's make
our ideal world!{end}

Lushiris, though I
appreciate being back ...{06}{07}
Could you enlighten
me as to why I
have been called back?{end}

I wish to enlist
your aid in this battle.{06}{07}
Here, the fate of
the Descendants of Light
will be decided.{06}{07}
Sadly, your descendant,
{02}, has
abandoned his mission.{end}

I see ...{end}

Are they headed this way?{06}{07}
Liana, be careful.
I don't mind letting you fight,
but don't endanger yourself.{end}

I am a Descendant of Light,
and I have never had
the choice of giving up ...{06}{07}
How kind of you
to offer that, Ledin.{end}

Looking at you
brings back old memories ...{06}{07}
The happy times
spent with my queen,
my wife ... Chris.{end}

Are you coming ...?
My Descendants ...{end}

I understand your power ...
Perhaps you ...{end}

L{37}na, please be careful.
Langrisser's power is immense.{end}

I know. As a maiden,
I understand the two swords
better than anyone else.{end}

It blows my mind to
say this ... but what am
I doing over there?{end}

You've come.
Langrisser ...
How amazing ...!{end}

I must find some way
to end Langrisser's power.{06}{07}
But to stop Langrisser ...
Can it be?
Can I truly defeat myself ...?{end}

S, sorry, Jessica ...{end}

How about that?
Did you enjoy the taste
of my magic?{end}

My magic should
be more potent in the
celestial realm ...{end}

If we don't
weaken them a bit ...{end}

I am the Guardian Knight
of the Heavens!{06}{07}
You will be punished
for defiling these grounds!{end}

To be beaten by ...
mortals ... Unthinkable!{end}

Oh my, they're invading
the celestial realm ...{end}

Such power ...!
But we must not lose!{end}

Right ... vanguard ...
broken through ...
Please, forgive ... me--{end}

Left ... vanguard ...
broken through ... Ugh--!{end}

Goddess ...
I ask your divine protection!{end}

Even a deity could
not match your strength ...{end}

An ostentatious sword
is buried deep in a pedestal.{06}{07}

On the pedestal, you see
some carefully chiselled words.{06}{07}

"Ye who desires this sabre
must vanquish the monster."{06}{07}

"With the fiend dead, thou
need not but call my name!"{06}{07}

What name will you call?{end}

Langrisser{end}

Dragon Slayer{end}

Alhazard{end}

The sword has been petrified.
It somehow seems different.{end}

You hear an echo as you draw
the sword from the pedestal.{end}

Obtained Dragon Slayer.{end}

You pulled too hard,
breaking the sword.{end}

Is it really over ...?{end}

But ... 
But to do this, Liana ...{end}

Our real work begins now.
We must bring
order to this world.{end}

Hah, it looks like we
picked the wrong profession,
wouldn't you say?{end}

I've come this far.
It looks like you are stuck with
me for the whole ride!{end}

I feel the
same as my brother!{end}

But we ...!{end}

Who ... are you?{end}

Liana ...?
Don't you recognise me?{end}

Uhhh ... Uugghhh ...
Please, stay away from me!{end}

{02} ...?
Why am I ...{end}

She is free from my spell ...
That is why she
still remembers {02} ...{end}

The spell has worn off!?
But if that happens,
then her memory will ...{end}

Liana!
Do you recognise me!?{end}

{02} ...
Lushiris sealed my memory ...
How can I still know him ...?{end}

Your memory was sealed, but
nothing could seal away
what you hide in your heart.{06}{07}
Your feelings for
{02} must be deep ...
Deep indeed ...{end}

Liana, I ...{end}

No ...! 
I am the Maiden of Light.{06}{07}
Protecting Langrisser ...
is my duty!
That's why, I ... Why I ...{06}{07}
Aaahhh ...!{end}

Why ...
Why are we enemies? {06}{07}
I don't want to fight,
but you left us ...
You abandoned me ...{end}

But, Liana!
That ...{end}

It's all right, I understand.
This world can be cruel ...{06}{07}
Let us battle, {02}!
We shall see whose
conviction is stronger!{end}

I wonder why ...{06}{07}
{02} ...
Why is it ...{06}{07}
When I fight you ...
I ... cry ...{end}

You erased your memories? {06}{07}
I don't understand ...!
Why would you do that?
Why must we fight!?{end}

This ...
It's too painful ...
Don't talk to me!{end}

What do you mean?{06}{07}
Are you saying you 
have no idea who I am?{end}
