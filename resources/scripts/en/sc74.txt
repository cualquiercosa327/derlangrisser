General Leon, the enemy
executes a surprise attack!{end}

Damn this ...
We have no time for it.{end}

You have chosen
to spit on the Empire's
generosity, {02}.{06}{07}
For this, I have no
quarrel with eliminating you.{end}

Bold words.{06}{07}
Leon, we just decimated
two of the Empire's
most elite divisions.{06}{07}
I don't imagine a third
will prove insurmountable.{end}

As Knights, we
understand our position
quite well, {02}.{06}{07}
Do not mistake
duty for arrogance.{06}{07}
If you leave here alive,
Vargas and Imelda
would go unavenged.{06}{07}
As a Knight and commander,
it is my chivalrous
task to see you buried.{end}

So then ...
You do put your ideals
before greater peace.{end}

Correct.
Nothing is more important
than loyalty and honour--{06}{07}
And by your own
demonstration ... you,
{02}, most certainly
understand neither!{end}

I'm not the Empire's
pet, if that is
what you are implying.{06}{07}
A man shouldn't ask
permission to preserve
his interests.{end}

Come at me, {02}.{06}{07}
I'll teach you the virtues
you can't possibly conceive of.{end}

As expected, Leon.
You overlook nothing ...{end}

As expected of the
Blue Dragon Knights.{06}{07}
They truly account for
every strategic consideration.{end}

I see ...
Persistence can do much ...{end}

Ugghh ...
What ability ...{end}

Those like us, those
with sufficient ability to lead,
we have no need of Empires.{06}{07}
Why are you still
bothering with yours?{end}

Do you think people can throw
their lives away? That they
can just do what they please?{06}{07}
We were so close, {02}!
So close to bringing peace to
this shattered continent.{06}{07}
But, your betrayal ...
your vicious nature ...
They polluted our dream.{06}{07}
Your own greed shackles
you more than any Empire.
I will never join you.{end}

I see.{end}

The time for talking is passed.
I'll take your sword
as a present to His Majesty.{06}{07}
Let us begin!{end}

This will be the end.
I, Laird, will have your head!
En garde, {02}!{end}

Hanging on the wall,
there's a fancy red bottle.{06}{07}

Will you drink from it?{end}

AT raised by 1 point!{06}{07}

You hear another bottle shatter.{end}

Hanging on the wall,
there's a fancy blue bottle.{06}{07}

Will you drink from it?{end}

MP raised by 2 points.{06}{07}

You hear another bottle shatter.{end}

Prepare yourself, Leon!{end}

Do you think
to defeat me?{end}

You are in
my way, move it!{end}

Damn it ...
I was careless in trying
to defeat B{3a}ser ...{end}

Take that!{end}

Impossible ...
How could
they be so strong ...{end}

So, would you
care for another round?{end}

All right.
Let's go.{end}

Hah hah hah!
Come! You can be my
partner in death!{end}

Damn, they really
are the strongest knights
on the continent ...{end}

I've waited a long time
to see my brother.{06}{07}
Don't think I'm some
harmless child any more.{end}

Do you think I won't win?
A simple theory to test!{end}

Run while you still can!{end}

Aaaahhh--!
N, not bad ...{end}

{font3}Aaarrgghh ...{end}

{font3}Such damage ...
This body is dying.{end}

{font3}Excellent!{end}

{font3}Grrrr ...
I must find a new body ...{end}

We cannot
be defeated here!{06}{07}
Sorcerers, give
them everything you have!{end}

Yes, Sir.
Leave it to me!{end}

I'll show you
our magical prowess!{end}

Colonel Laird!{end}

You shall not
enter the castle!{end}

G, General Leon ...
I'm sorry ...{end}

Sorry ... to lose my life ...
in such a place ...{end}

You've done well.
Leon would certainly praise
your final actions.{end}

Now is your chance, Laird!
Attack swiftly--strike
at them like the four winds!{end}

Yes Sir, General.{end}

We are the Empire's last
and greatest hope.{06}{07}
We will ensure its survival!
All troops, charge ahead!{end}

I won't let you through!
You are the bastard
who betrayed General Leon!{end}

You little shits ...
This should take care of you!{end}

Gaaaahhh!{end}

Laird, hang in there!{end}

General Leon, Sir ...
It appears as though this
is where I depart ...{end}

Laird, stand up.
We still have
a battle to fight.{06}{07}
Laird, come on.
Take my ...{06}{07}
Laird ...?{06}{07}
Oh Laird!
You won't die here, 
I won't permit it ...!{06}{07}
Laird, get up!{end}

General, thank you ...
for giving me
something to fight for.{06}{07}
Not everyone ...
has such a privilege ...{end}

Laird ... No!
Laird, please get up!{06}{07}
Open your eyes, Laird.
Please, open your eyes!{end}

I'm sorry, ...
Please carry on ...
the Empire ...{end}

I'll hold back
these filthy rebels!{end}

Worthless fool!
You won't soon forget the
burns of our sorcery!{end}

I ... I'm finished ...{end}

Soldier, you are
relieved from duty!{06}{07}
Please take a rest.
I will finish things here ...{end}

I beg your pardon ... 
Uugghh ...{end}

Our Empire cannot be
destroyed! It exists
beyond those who serve it!{end}

General Leon!{end}

Let's go!{end}

For the glory of
the Rayguard Empire!{end}

Their party is formidable.
Everyone, remain focused.{06}{07}
Indecision or haste
will surely be fatal.{end}

To think we shared
the same ideals of peace ...{06}{07}
Be it victory or defeat,
let's go, {02}!{end}

That is just
what I wanted to hear!{end}

Stay back!
I can't simply turn aside!{end}

Gaaahh ... Aaarrghh!{end}

General Leon, please,
you must hold out!
No ... General Leon!{end}

I'm so confused, Laird.
Is this really ...
my time to die ...{end}

Someone, help now!
Get our General inside!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

General Leon, be at ease.
I'll trade my life for yours ...{end}

Sorry, Laird ...
Continue to fight ..., but
don't do anything brash.{06}{07}
The renewed Empire ...
It will need its finest ...
men to aid it ...{end}

We are the Blue Dragon Knights!
Have no regrets about giving
your lives for General Leon!{end}

Lives given willingly
shall be taken in turn.{end}

Aaarrggghh ...!{end}

We are the only aerial units.
There is no
excuse for us to fail.{end}

Shall we exchange blows?{end}

Mobility alone ...
isn't enough ...{end}

I live by the sword
and die by love! You losers
don't know that strength.{end}

My wife ... E, Elena ...
I wanted to see you ...
once ... more ...{end}

How can this be ...?
The Blue Dragon Knights
reduced to one man ...{06}{07}
This is too much to bear.
But ... No, I will fight ...
I will fight for tomorrow!{end}

Come on, Leon.
If you surrender quietly,
I will spare your life.{end}

{02} ...
Go fuck yourself.{06}{07}
Do you see anyone
who died for me here?
Maybe a few?{06}{07}
With the Blue Dragon Knights
ended ... I am left with no
purpose, save for killing you.{end}

What have you done!?
I'm, I'm the only one left,
the last Blue Dragon ...!{end}

You are no longer
a Blue Dragon, Leon.{06}{07}
Look around you, Leon.
Do you see an army? Do you see
your fellow knights here to stand
against us once more?{06}{07}
Your army is done for, and the
Empire is in its last hours.
Now, you are just a lone man
facing an important choice.{06}{07}
If you choose to surrender,
I promise I will spare your life.{end}

If you choose to surrender,
I promise I will spare your life.{end}

I refuse.{06}{07}
I shall enter death as a soldier
and make my peace with Leon.{06}{07}
This life ... until it ends,
I will continue in my duties.{end}

The Blue Dragon Knights ...
Leon ... They
were decent company.{end}

Certainly. All that's left
is the Kaiser and
his rusty old throne.{06}{07}
And after we have defeated him,
the Descendants of Light ...{end}

At last, the decisive battle.{end}

At last, the final confrontation.{end}

I see, Liana too ...{end}

I see, Liana too ...{end}

Now, the last battle with
the Empire is just ahead.
Let's go, everyone!{end}

What do you think you're
doing, waltzing into our castle?{06}{07}
Come back here and fight me!{end}

You bastard!
Where do you think
you are going?{06}{07}
The only way you're getting
further is through my death.{end}

We're nowhere near defeat!
Are you trying to make fools of
the Blue Dragon Knights!?{end}

It seems they have
already closed the gates.{06}{07}
We may have beaten
the enemy, but we
still need to break the gate.{end}

What a noble spirit he has.
They really go above
and beyond simple enemies.{06}{07}
Regardless, now it's
time to enter the castle.{06}{07}
And, well well,
there goes the Empire.{end}

We are the Empires finest
tacticians. Don't
think to outwit us, {02}.{end}
