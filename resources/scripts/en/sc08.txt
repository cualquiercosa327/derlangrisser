Eeek!{end}

You there, woman!
If you do not want to die,
answer my questions!{06}{07}
Does a girl named Liana
live in this house?{end}

Y, yes ...{end}

Who is outside ...!?{end}

General Leon!
The girl we were assigned
to bring in is here!{end}

I see. Thank goodness.{end}

Let us get this over with.
The local Lord's troops must
already be on their way.{end}

You are probably right ...{end}

Hurry up, Baldo!
If the Salrath Army shows up,
this could get messy.{end}

Understood!{end}

{02}, this is serious!{end}

What's the matter, Hein?{end}

A detachment of knights
from the Rayguard Empire
is invading the village!{end}

What ...!?{06}{07}
Hein!
It looks like they are only
attacking the outskirts!{06}{07}
Isn't that where you said
your childhood friend lives?{end}

That is right!{06}{07}
She must already be
in terrible danger!
Will you lend me a hand?{end}

Yes, of course.
Let's go!{end}

This just keeps
getting worse. {02}!{06}{07}
The Imperial Knights are
here to kidnap Liana!{end}

Why would Rayguard go
through so much trouble
for just one girl ...?{06}{07}
There is no time to
think about that now.
We have to hurry and help her!{end}

Ridel!
They are powerful foes indeed!{06}{07}
But no matter how strong they
may be, we have to hold them
off until His Lordship's troops
arrive, ... no matter the cost.{end}

I know ...
I will try to hold them back
with my spearmen...{06}{07}
It seems the rumours
calling them the strongest
knights in the land may have
some merit after all ...{end}

Evan ... ze--!{end}

Ridel--!{end}

I have come to rescue you!{end}

Thank you for your offer,
but please, save yourself!{end}

I will save you, Liana!{end}

Hein!
Please do not come any closer!
I don't want to see you hurt ...{end}

Okay, mission accomplished.
Let us head back to 
the Imperial Capital.{end}

So, ... you are {02}, eh?
Well, ... mind your
own damn business, kid!{06}{07}
It will be a cold day
in hell before you best
Baldo in a fight!
Ha ha ha!{end}

Gah ...
This should not have
been ... possible--!{end}

I knew it, {02}!
There can be no more doubt--
the knights are here for Liana!{end}

So it seems ...
Concentrate on attacking
their commander, Baldo.{end}

If things keep going
like this, Liana
will surely be kidnapped!{06}{07}
Concentrate on attacking their
commanding officer, Baldo.{end}

You have spotted a clearing
in the middle of the woods ...{06}{07}

Inside, a band of cute
dwarves are dancing merrily.{06}{07}

One of the dwarves comes
out to offer you a berry.{end}

Will you eat the berry?{end}

Magic Defence raised!{end}

A blue potion rests within
the open drawer of a chest.{end}

Will you drink it?{end}

You feel a surge of power!{06}{07}
AT raised by 1 point!{end}

Argh ...
Not here ...!{end}

That is far enough!{end}

Oh no! Stay back!
Just forget
about me and escape!{06}{07}
Why should those who
have nothing to do with
me suffer as well?{end}

Wait for me!
I will rescue you no
matter what.{end}

I won't let you get
away with this!{end}

Sorry, {02} ...
I was not strong enough. You'll
have to rescue Liana alone.{end}

Hey, Liana!
I am on my way!{end}

No, Hein!
It is too dangerous!
Forget me and save yourself!{end}

You damned Imperials!
Get out of this village!{end}

Help!{end}

General Leon!
What should we do with
this villager?{06}{07}
Nobody was supposed
to discover
our actions here.{end}

Do not needlessly
shed the blood of innocents.{06}{07}
We have not come
today to commit murder.{end}

Your duty is to arrange
for Baldo's safe retreat!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Knights, I am issuing a decree!
Such pointless killing is
forbidden on our mission.{end}

At ease.
Our mission is no to
commit murder.{end}

Yes, ... Sir.{end}

Hey, you! Move it!
You are in my way!{end}

Eeek!
Help me!{end}

Baldo, wait!
You are forbidden to
act without orders!{end}

Evanze, let's go!{end}

Yes, it is up to us.{end}

I will protect this
village with my life!{end}

You dare attack spearmen
with cavalry ...?
Are you mocking me!?{end}

Evanze ...
I am sorry ...{end}

Nooo!
Ridel, you mustn't die!
We had a promise!{06}{07}
You said we'd be
together ... forever ...{end}

Ridel ...{end}

Shriek--!{end}

Evanze!
Hang on!{end}

I'm ... so sorry.
Please forgive me ...{06}{07}
I couldn't keep ...
my promise to be with you ...{end}

What are you saying!?
You'll be all right, it is
only a small wound!{end}

Ridel, ...{06}{07}
I ... love you ...,
Ri ... del ...{end}

Evanze!{end}

Unforgivable ...!{06}{07}
I can never forgive you!
I will kill you with
my own two hands!{end}

All right, let us go and
assist Baldo with the girl!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Laird, follow me!
I will sweep out the enemy!{end}

Understood!{end}

Im, impossible!{06}{07}
How can I, the leader
of the Blue Dragon Knights,
possibly lose?{end}

Why?
Why do the Blue Dragon Knights
pursue this one village girl?{end}

We shall not divulge
our mission's purpose to
those not involved.{end}

I've heard not only
that the Blue Dragon Knights
are the strongest in the land ...{06}{07}
but also that they value
chivalry above all else!
Why now do you engage in
such a contemptible act!?{end}

Keep going, General!{end}

Be careful, Laird.
The enemy units wield spears.{end}

I'll pierce through their ranks
with a wave-patterned attack,
then target their commander.{end}

Do your best.{end}

General Leon!{end}

Do not be foolhardy!
I'll handle the rest!{end}

Pathetic!
More than spears are needed to
turn the Blue Dragon Knights!{end}

Oh, really ...?
Then Sir, allow me to
test your boast!{end}

You must be Lady Liana.{06}{07}
I ask you come with us
quietly to the Imperial Capital.
No one needs to be harmed.{end}

Wh, what ...
do you want with me?{end}

I apologise for the
suddenness of our arrival.{06}{07}
I am Leon, the commander
of the Rayguard Empire's
Blue Dragon Knights.
I was sent to retrieve you.{end}

Me ...?{end}

His Majesty, the great
Kaiser Bernhardt, waits for you
at the Imperial Capital.{06}{07}
I shall be your escort.{end}

Do you promise you will
leave the villagers
alone if I follow quietly?{end}

Of course.
It is already dishonourable to
be seen kidnapping a woman.{06}{07}
I have no intention of further
shaming ourselves by
killing defenceless people.{06}{07}
However, those who would bear
arms against us shall
forfeit this assurance of safety.{end}

I understand ...
Then under these conditions
I will follow you.{end}

I am sorry for all this ...
Thank you for your
cooperation in this matter.{end}

Let's go, little girl!
Hurry up and follow me!{end}

Sigh ...
A mission without swordplay
is just ever so dull ...{06}{07}
Maybe I can have
some fun with the young
ladies over there!{end}

Stop it!
You promised you would not
hurt any of them!{end}

Shut up, bitch!{06}{07}
Now that we have you
under arrest, that
"promise" is meaningless!{06}{07}
Ha ha ha!{end}

Well then, ...
let us take her back
to headquarters.{06}{07}
However ...
Baldo, you would do well
to be polite to her.{end}

Yes, Sir--!
I will take care
from now on.{end}

Halt!
You cannot do as you
please in this village!{end}

General Leon!
The local militia has come!{end}

How quickly ...
But it matters not. Continue
the mission as planned!{end}

You dare to mock us!?
I will make you regret ever
violating our village's peace!{end}

Sigh ...
Such foolishness ...{end}

Come on, get over here!{end}

Ouch!
I'll follow, but please do
not pull so roughly!{end}

God damn, you're quite the
impudent little wench--!{06}{07}
Damn it all!
The things I have to put
up with on these missions ...{end}

You must be stupid to pick
a fight with Baldo, kid!{06}{07}
You have no idea who
you're going up against!{06}{07}
I am going to
enjoy playing with you!{end}

Impossible ...
G, General Leon!{end}

What!?
How is it possible ...
Baldo has been ... bested?{end}

Laird!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

We must leave
immediately and escort
the girl ourselves.{06}{07}
She must be brought
to the Imperial Capital
without fail.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

What!?
How could we have failed?{end}

I came as soon as
I received word of the
trouble here ...{06}{07}
What in Lushiris' name ...!?{end}

Amazing ...!{06}{07}
The Blue Dragon Knights
have been completely defeated
by those young men!{end}

Thank goodness.
It seems I was a little late.{end}

I am responsible for the
welfare of the men
and women in my territory.{end}

We must drive out
the Imperial Knights!{end}

It's the local Lord's army!{end}

Enemy reinforcements
have arrived!{end}

What horrible timing ...
We have no choice but
to retreat for now!{end}

As you command, Sir.{end}

The enemy's reinforcements
have arrived!?{06}{07}
This doesn't look good.
We must retreat!{end}

Lady Liana ...
We shall be returning
to finish this.{end}

It seems to be over.{end}

Thank you for helping me,
Sir swordsman.{06}{07}
I am Liana, a priestess
from the Shrine of Light.
What is your name?{end}

My name is {02}.
I am on an aimless journey.{end}

Lord {02}, my most
sincere thanks to you.{06}{07}
I know not if I was worth
your rescue effort, but
I really do appreciate it ...{end}

You really don't have
to say such things ...
Anyway, are you hurt?{end}

No, ... I'm all right.{06}{07}
I should be the one asking
you, Lord {02}, if you
have been injured--{end}

I'm fine, Lady Liana.{06}{07}
You needn't call me
"Lord {02}." I've never
been much for formality.{06}{07}
Just call me {02}.{end}

Well then, you
can call me Liana.{end}

You were amazing
out there, {02}!{end}

Hein, I want to thank
you for your help, too.{end}

Well everyone, I'm
glad to hear that none
of you were harmed.{06}{07}
But it's too soon to rest easy.
The Knights will surely return
to finish what they began.{06}{07}
You'll have to take
refuge with me in Salrath
for your own sake as well
as that of the villagers.{end}

His Lordship is right.
Let us depart immediately.{end}

Wait a moment!
I am sorry I wasn't able to
provide better support ...{end}

That's not true. We could never
have won if you hadn't drawn
the cavalry's attention.{end}

Your words are very
kind, good Sir {02}.{06}{07}
I know not what to say.
Please take this with you
as a token of my gratitude.{end}

{02} was handed 100P.{end}

Thank you, I appreciate it.{end}

The world is a dangerous place.
It's always better to
have some extra money.{end}

I guess so ...{end}

Well then, let's be on our way.
It's getting dark, and my
stomach is already growling!{end}

Hein ...!{end}

Very well then, let us be off.{end}

I shall guide you to our manor.{end}

Such a quiet night ...
I dreamt of intense,
endless battle ...{06}{07}
Was Liana really the target of
the Blue Dragon Knights today?{06}{07}
The Knights are said
to be the strongest force
of the Rayguard Empire.{06}{07}
Why is Liana so
important to them ...?
Why did I go out of my way to
rescue her from the Imperials?{06}{07}
Is she ... important to me?{end}

Unable to sleep,
Lord {02}?{end}

Yeah, ...
I was worried about what
happened earlier today.{06}{07}
I can't help think that
something terrible has begun ...
It's a strange feeling ...{end}

I'm sorry ...
You were so brave
out there today.{06}{07}
{02}, you treat me
as though we've known
each other for many years.{06}{07}
Were my father still alive,
I'm sure he would be as kind
and strong as you, {02}.{06}{07}
Ah, ... what am I saying ...!?{end}

I apologise for saying
such strange things ...{end}

I don't mind ...
Up until now, your life
has been difficult, hasn't it?{06}{07}
I heard of your
childhood from Hein.{end}

Yes ...
As a baby, I was abandoned on
the steps of the village shrine.{06}{07}
The priest there raised
me in my parents' stead ...{06}{07}
Because of his kindness
and warmth, I never
felt lonely or sad.{end}

I see ...{end}

{02} ...
Why do you travel the country?{06}{07}
If it's all right,
I'd like to know.{end}

My journeys have neither
reason nor purpose.{06}{07}
Both my parents died
when I was very young.{06}{07}
After that, I was raised by
a man named Doren.
He was my guardian
and mentor.{06}{07}
He was brilliant, and he saw
fit to teach me many things.
His instruction in swordplay
was most rigorous.{06}{07}
With his death, ...
I am ... free.{end}

"Free?"
I don't understand ...{end}

Since Doren ... passed on ...
I have been alone in the world.{06}{07}
Now, I wander the land
searching for his slayer.{end}

Is that so ...?{06}{07}
I'm sorry for rousing
such terrible memories.{end}

It's okay, I don't mind.
The night is half-over.{06}{07}
You should return to your
chamber and rest.
We'll be departing
early in the morning.{end}

Good night ...
Sir {02}.{end}

{02}--!{end}

Huh?
Is there something else, Liana?{end}

Umm, ...
thank you ...{end}

Baldo's retreat
appears to be secure!{end}

I've never had such
a mission as this before.{06}{07}
A soldier of war ...
witnessed here
abducting a girl ...
What a disgrace ...{end}

Please do not let it
get to you, General.{06}{07}
For me, it's a great honour just
to serve under your command.{end}

I appreciate your words,
but don't get careless now.{end}

Hmph, ... only these two?
Barely even worth the effort.{end}

Don't underestimate them--{06}{07}
And don't be arrogant!
On the battlefield, you
will not survive if you
are not cool-headed.{end}

You can't fight well
if you are wounded.{06}{07}
Try to place the units
under your command
directly around yourself.{06}{07}
Your men will recover
some of their physical
strength each turn.{06}{07}
Value your men's lives as
though they were your own.{end}

I understand.{end}

Let's go!{end}

I won't go down that easily!{end}

G, General Leon, Sir ...
I am sorry ...
Please forgive me--!{end}

No ...!
I allowed one of my
subordinates to perish ...{end}

You fight well!
How long can you
keep it up ...?{end}

Shit!
You impertinent asshole!
I'll see you dead for that!{end}

Be silent!
I cannot bear your ignorance!{06}{07}
The General does not undertake
this mission of his own volition!{06}{07}
We act today only due
to a direct order from
Kaiser Bernhardt himself!{end}

You bastard ...
You're going to die for
getting on my nerves!{end}

It's all right, Laird.{06}{07}
It is unworthy of us to
make excuses for such
dishonourable actions.{06}{07}
I can endure the disgrace
of a mission like this,
but not the loss of my men.{end}

Eeeek!{end}

How cruel!
How can you do such a thing?{end}

Shut up, you bitch!
Or would you like a taste too!?{end}

Stop it!
You reckless fool!{06}{07}
I issued an order that all
troops operating under my
command are to refrain from
such useless slaughter!{06}{07}
I will not repeat myself again!
Anyone disobeying my
commands is unnecessary
to this operation.{end}

Yes, Sir ...
I'm sorry ..., General.{end}

How cruel ...{end}

Remember your promise!
Don't harm the
people of this village!{end}

I never said anything about
sparing those who would
brandish arms against us.{end}

But--!{end}

I beg you, please!
Just let me go with them
to the Imperial Capital!{06}{07}
If I go with the Imperial Army,
all of this will be over ...{end}

I ... can't ...{06}{07}
I ... can't ...
allow that ...{end}

How foolish ...{end}

I ... I won't give up ...{end}

I cannot forfeit the
lives of those I love!{end}

How foolish ...{end}

I cannot forgive those
who would interfere ...
This is the only way!{end}

But--!{end}
