Work quickly!
We'll need this place as
well-fortified as possible!{end}

Our troops are
making the preparations
as you speak.{end}

The Empire has both
Alhazard and Langrisser,
don't they ...?{06}{07}
They won't lay around.
They'll crush us in one
vulgar display of power.{06}{07}
Really, is there
any way to win against
these odds?{end}

Don't count us out just yet.
We have a few
ideas up our sleeves.{06}{07}
But there's still
plenty of work to do.{end}

The Empire is moving
very fast in this operation ...{06}{07}
And even twice the time
wouldn't have been enough.{06}{07}
However, if we work as
one and cover our
weaknesses, we'll prevail.{end}

Oh, look!
The guests of honour have
finally arrived.{end}

Castle Kalxath?
It seems like yesterday ...{06}{07}
Who'd have thought
I'd revisit it with
my former enemies?{end}

Gwah hah hah!
Last time, we had to pull
back because of you!{06}{07}
Now, we'll take
Kalxath with ease.
Glad you're aboard!{end}

This is their stronghold.
If we rout them here,
Kalxath will be no more.{06}{07}
We must achieve victory.
His Majesty has requested
our greatest efforts.{end}

Heh heh ...
Just leave it to me!{end}

There are additional orders.
We must apprehend
the girl named Liana.{06}{07}
If she dies, our
mission is a failure.
Keep that in mind.{end}

We need to
capture Liana?{end}

That's right.
We need her to unlock
Alhazard's potential.{06}{07}
The seal placed on the
sword may only be dissolved
by the Maiden of Light.{end}

So that's why.{end}

So that's why the Empire's
been after Liana
all this time, isn't it?{end}

Correct.{06}{07}
If I close in on Liana,
I can teleport her
and myself to Rayguard.{06}{07}
Hold off her meddlesome
friends, and I'll
take care of the rest.{06}{07}
Of course, it would be
ideal if you could kill them
all in the process.{end}

Got it.
All right, let's
go, everyone!{end}

It's finally begun ...
Who would have dreamt ...{06}{07}
{02}, our once staunch
friend and ally, lays siege
to the castle he protected ...{end}

Liana's trying to escape.
We can't let that happen!{06}{07}
Hurry and catch her!{end}

Liana's trying to run away.
We can't allow that!{end}

My teacher never
fails to impress.
She knows our objective ...{end}

Circling around the back
may be the best strategy ...
Or, perhaps ...{end}

Don't be hasty, {02}.{06}{07}
We must assess their
deployment more fully before
devising our plan.{end}

Yes, you're right.{06}{07}
We will skilfully
employ our troops and prevent
Liana's movement.{end}

It's down to
Liana and myself, is it?{06}{07}
If we turn in here,
Alhazard will burn
this world to ash.{06}{07}
We must fight
to the end!{end}

I understand ...
and I will help you with
all that I have.{end}

Oh no, she's escaped!{end}

The seal on Alhazard 
must never be broken.{06}{07}
That's why I cannot
let myself be captured ...{06}{07}
Farewell, everyone ...
Farewell, {02}.{end}

We won't kill you,
but you won't escape, either!{end}

Ah ...
Why do things happen ...
as they do ...{end}

We're unsealing
Alhazard's power!
Come join us!{end}

Don't get in my
way, Cherie!{end}

No!
I won't back down, ever!{end}

Ugh!
If Alhazard's awakened,
is it all over ...?{end}

I'm sorry. 
I was beaten ...{end}

These Kalxath troops
are nothing to sneeze at.{06}{07}
They caught even
me off guard ...{end}

Damn! These rotten
Kalxath soldiers are
better than I thought!{end}

Your futile
efforts insult my beauty ...
I'm leaving!{end}

Ugh, bastard ...
Looks like this castle
has it in for me.{end}

Don't think you can
run away from me ...{end}

Egbert!
How dare you
come here!{end}

Hmph ...
Always the spirited lad.{end}

Hmph ...
Nothing to do but
pull out for now.{06}{07}
My apologies. To catch Liana,
you'll need to wipe
out our remaining enemies.{end}

Leave it to us, Egbert.
We'll ensure this
operation's success!{end}

...
I'm counting on you.{end}

Jessica, please
prepare to fall back!{06}{07}
Without your support,
we Descendants of Light
would be devastated ...{end}

...{06}{07}
I see.
Very well, then.{end}

Let's go, Liana.
Please stay close.{end}

We don't have
much time, Liana!
We need to hurry!{end}

Yes.{end}

I, I can't move any more ...
Liana, go on without me.{end}

You might get away
with this elsewhere,
but you won't in Kalxath!{end}

How dare you do
that to Keith!{end}

It's payback time!{end}

Aaaahh!{end}

Princess!{end}

I'm sorry, Keith ...{06}{07}
In this condition, I'm
just in the way.
I'll retreat this time ...{end}

I'm not going to let
Imperial scum
near this castle!{06}{07}
I'm going to kick
all your asses!{end}

I won't forgive this!
Keith, I'll avenge you!{end}

Aaaarrgghhh!
This one's for Keith!{end}

Lady Jessica, forgive me!
It looks like I
can no longer fight ...{end}

Sorry, Keith.
I didn't avenge your death here,
but I'll make up for lost time ...{end}

At, at this rate ...{end}

Princess, leave this place!
Please join Lady Liana
and Lady Jessica.{end}

Attention, everyone
in the castle!{06}{07}
We must retreat for now
and plan our counterattack!{end}

But Keith!{end}

But Keith!{end}

I'll stop this
invasion with my life!{end}

Lord Lester!
Please ..., please take
care of the others.{end}

Th, this is it ...{end}

Princess ...
Please leave here. Follow 
Lady Liana and Lady Jessica ...{end}

Princess ... 
Please leave here
with Lady Liana ...{end}

I'm ... done for.
Please leave with the Princess
and plan a ... counterattack.{end}

But Keith!{end}

But Keith!{end}

As long as the Princess lives,
I have no regrets ...{end}

Lord Lester.
Please ..., please look
after the others...{end}

Keith ...{end}

For the glory of Kalxath!
And for true peace
throughout the world!{end}

Arrgh!
N, not yet ...{06}{07}
We ... Kalxath ...
Can't give in ...{end}

K, Keith!{end}

K, Keith!{end}

...{06}{07}
Farewell, ... my friend.{end}

...{06}{07}
Farewell, ... my friend.{end}

I'm so sorry, Keith ...
I ...{06}{07}
It's all my fault ...{end}

Everyone is
fighting for me ...{06}{07}
I can't let them down ...
I won't get captured.
I have to hurry!{end}

Aaahh!{end}

The girl has died?
What the hell happened!?{end}

No!
Now that Liana has died,
Alhazard's seal can't ...!{end}

Don't think you can
just barge on in!{end}

This is personal.
I'll make anyone attacking this
castle sorry they were born.{end}

If you want to enter
the castle, you'll
have to get through me!{end}

I won't let this castle fall
to the likes of you! Die!{end}

My magic should
have been unstoppable ...
Ugghh!{end}

You must think you're pretty
great for coming this far.
Too bad you won't go further!{end}

I ...
I haven't ...{end}

I, I'm falling!{end}

If, If I only had
a little more power ...{end}

You shall not pass!{end}

Do you call this a wound?
It's barely a scratch!{end}

Now, Liana.
There's nowhere to run.{06}{07}
Be a good girl
and come with me.{end}

Why ...?
{02}, why have
you changed so much?{end}

Liana ...{end}

When we first met,
you were so kind ...
You hated war ...{end}

That hasn't changed.{06}{07}
I want this conflict to end
quickly and thoroughly, so I'm
lending myself to the Empire.{end}

Well, you're doing
a terrible job!{06}{07}
Can you say the Empire
brought peace to Kalxath?
Can you!?{end}

This place may indeed
have been a haven of sorts.{06}{07}
But in all my travels,
I've witnessed nothing but
siege and bloodshed.{06}{07}
To truly sever the roots of
war, the world needs a
strong, unified kingdom!{end}

You have changed,
after all ...{06}{07}
The {02} I knew
would not look for peace
through tyranny ...{06}{07}
He'd have faith that
everyone wants
to live free of suffering!{end}

...{06}{07}
I'm getting very tired
of explaining myself.
Liana, I'm taking you with me.{end}

{02} ...{end}

I understand ...
Just don't throw
your life away.{06}{07}
Don't worry and fight
with all your heart!{end}

If I die, then the
castle's defence will ...{end}

I ... cannot allow you to
breach ... the walls.{end}

So you're saying I should
abandon Castle Kalxath!?{end}

Keith! You're saying I
should just abandon
you all and run away!?{end}

Egbert is pressing forward ...
What!? Could he be ...?{end}

What's wrong,
Lady Jessica?{end}

Liana, run away, now!{end}

What?{end}

Liana, you must escape!
Make your preparations and go!{06}{07}
The Empire's aim
is not only the
fall of Castle Kalxath.{06}{07}
They're intending
to capture you as well!{end}

Me ...?{end}

They probably want
you to unseal Alhazard.{06}{07}
I'll guard you all
the way to the rear.
Hurry and escape!{end}

Liana, it's only
a little bit further!{end}

Okay!{end}

Leave the castle to us
and escape, Lady Jessica!{end}

...{06}{07}
Very well.{end}

If I don't hurry,
everyone will have
fought for nothing ...{end}

Maiden of Light, 
would you be so kind
as to accompany me?{end}

No! Let me go!{end}

Stop it, Egbert!{end}

Liana! I'm coming!{end}

Heh heh heh ...
I'm afraid you won't get away.
Ahem ...{06}{07}
Watchers of time and space ...
Honour your ancient pledge
and send her to another land ...{end}

Sh, she disappeared ...?
Where could she have gone!?{end}

Whew, mission accomplished.{end}

Now the seal
can be broken.{06}{07}
To conduct the ceremony,
we must head toward
the Underground Shrine.{end}

All right, there's no reason
to hang around here.
Let's begin our transfer!{end}

All your traipsing around
is driving me nuts!{06}{07}
No one should ever,
ever interrupt my nap!{06}{07}
Hmm? What is it?
Are you trying to tell me
you want something?{end}

You greedy fellows
irritate me to no end!{end}

Go ahead and take this.
Humble people are
very important, after all.{06}{07}
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going back to sleep ...{end}

Obtained Dragon Scale.{end}
