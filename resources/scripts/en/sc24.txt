The Holy Rod is on an
altar inside this temple.{end}

We'll have to split
up and check each
area individually.{end}

Won't this waste
a lot of time ...?{end}

What?
Somebody is approaching!
Is it the enemy!?{end}

It's here.
Somewhere within these ruins
we'll find the Holy Rod.{end}

Hey, Hein ...
Don't you know any spells
that could locate it?{end}

Heh, if only life were
so simple, Lester ...{end}

What!{06}{07}
The Blue Dragon Knights
are here ...!{end}

Is that Rohga
leading the enemy
search party ...?{06}{07}
Yes, it is him!{end}

{02}'s bunch?{06}{07}
Move fast!
We must find it
before they do!{end}

He seems to be after
the rod as well.{06}{07}
Let's hurry!{end}

Everyone, let's go!{06}{07}
We cannot back down,
even for a former ally!{end}

Let's split and search!{end}

I'll check the
left interior room.{end}

You check the left side.{end}

You check the right side.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Understood.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

No matter what, we cannot
let them take the Holy Rod!{end}

Sorry for being late.{end}

Leon!
Are you all right?{06}{07}
Weren't you injured
in the battle before?{06}{07}
Please, let me
handle this, Sir.{end}

Don't worry about me.{06}{07}
I can't leave this
all up to you.{end}

Damn!
We're a little late!{end}

Leon!{end}

All right!
The operation is complete!
Withdraw!{end}

Damn, if we had a
little more time ...{end}

Damn.
This is it ...{end}

Ugh.
Now I see how useless I am.{end}

Oww!
How could you hurt such
a helpless little girl?{end}

Ugh!
I messed up ...{end}

Damn ...!
You're really good!{end}

Argh!
This is all the
strength I've left ...{end}

Ah!
I can't move ...{end}

Sorry.
I'm pulling out ...{end}

{02}!
You won't get the Holy Rod!{end}

My wound still
hasn't healed ...{06}{07}
{02},
I will pay you
back for this!{end}

I won't tolerate failure!
Find the Rod, now!{end}

Let's go!{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
I'm not much of a talker.
For me, everything I know,
everything I feel, I learn
through my sword.{06}{07}
Ever since I met you,
I've wanted to do battle
with you just once!{06}{07}
Show me what
kind of a man you are!{end}

Rohga ...
I don't want this!{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
The time for such
words is long past.{06}{07}
I buried our former
allegience in that
cemetery with Ikreuz!{06}{07}
Come on, fight me,
and don't hold back!{end}

Such strength ...
To imagine there are fighters
even more powerful than I ...{06}{07}
I'm proud to have battled
with and against a warrior
as great as you, {02}.{end}

Rohga ...{end}

Farewell ...!{06}{07}
May we meet again
in the underworld!{end}

Damn ...
You're pretty good!{end}

You, search the left!{end}

Inconceivable--!{end}

Uggh,
how could I die here--{end}

Let's continue
the evacuation.{end}

Argh--{end}

Ahh.
I'm losing strength--{end}

I am sorry,
my beloved ...{06}{07}
I don't think I'll
survive this time ...{end}

You are
strong indeed ...{end}

Aahh--!
I can't ...{end}

At last, the time for
me to meet my departed
friends has come ...{06}{07}
Gah--arrgghh ...!{end}

Gah--!{end}

Finally, it's over ...{end}

Well, let's find
the Holy Rod.{end}

I found it!
This is the Holy Rod!{end}

Obtained Holy Rod.{end}

Finally, it's over ...{end}

Well, let's find
the Holy Rod.{end}

I found it!
This is the Holy Rod!{end}

Obtained Holy Rod.{end}

There it is!{end}

Oh! I found it!{end}

It's here!{end}

I've discovered it!{end}

Heh heh.
I found it!{end}

Here it is!{end}

There it is.
It's right here!{end}

I found it here!{end}

Found it!{end}

Here it is!{end}

I have discovered it!{end}

It's not here ...{end}

Tsk, can't find it.{end}

It doesn't look
like it's here.{end}

It's not here ...{end}

Damn, not here.{end}

It's not over here.{end}

I can't find it.{end}

I guess it isn't here.{end}

It's not over here!{end}

There's nothing here!{end}

Not here ...{end}

Hurry!
We can't let them leave
with the Holy Rod!{end}

You won't take
the Holy Rod!{end}

All right, listen
up, everybody!{06}{07}
Gather around the
temple, and prepare for
the enemies attack!{end}

Men, battle stations!{06}{07}
Gather at the temple entrance.
We must repel the enemy.{end}

I have taken
the Holy Rod!{end}

I've got the Holy Rod!{end}

Obtained Holy Rod.{end}

All right, let's go outside!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

I have the Holy Rod.{06}{07}
I'm heading for the
exit, so cover me!{end}

Obtained Holy Rod.{end}

All right, let's
hurry and escape!{06}{07}
Have the others back me up!{end}

Damn! They beat us ...
Don't let them get away!{06}{07}
Take back the rod!{end}

We did it!
Now we can stand
against Alhazard!{end}

...{end}

Big sister ...{end}

Fighting Leon is
painful for you, isn't it?{end}

N, no ...
It's all right ...{06}{07}
Alhazard must be sealed.
Even if we have
to do things like this ...{end}

We will end this war.{06}{07}
I just hope we may see
a day when we aren't divided
as enemies and allies ...{end}

Yeah ...
But first we must release
Langrisser's seal.{end}

At last, we can release
Langrisser's seal ...{end}

Let's hurry with the
incantations, sister!{end}

Yeah!{end}

Unbind the Light that
rests within me ...{end}

Empower this sword
with the power of Light
that rests within me ...{end}

Charge the Holy Rod
with light ...{end}

Now to bring forth the
sword's true power!{end}

What a magnificent glow ...{end}

Langrisser's hidden
power has been released!{end}

With Langrisser revived, we'll
show Bernhardt the true power
of the Descendants of Light!{end}

It will only get tougher
from here on out.{06}{07}
However, if we work
and act as one, we can
overcome any difficulty.{06}{07}
If we all have faith in
ourselves, we can succeed.{06}{07}
If we believe in hope,
the Sword of Light will
shine even brighter.{end}

I'll ... give it my all!{end}

All right!
I'm going to give it
everything I've got, too!{end}

We've made it this far ...
We can do it!{end}

Let's work together!{end}

As long as I continue to
have strength, I'll fight!{end}

You can count on
me till the end!{end}

Let's go!
We shall fight
as one!{end}

Everyone ... {end}

All right, let's do it!
To Castle Velzeria!{end}

In a vacant spot of earth
there is a glittering garb.{06}{07}

Will you take it?{end}

Obtained Wizard's Robe.{end}
