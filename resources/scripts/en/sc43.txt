Just beyond this
bridge lies the forbidden
soil of Velzeria.{end}

Those demons will think
twice before attacking us while
we hold Langrisser, I bet!{end}

Maybe so Hein, but you should
never underestimate your
enemies on the battlefield.{end}

I'll have to remember
that, Keith. But I doubt
anything will happ--{end}

Langrisser's seal is broken,
Descendants of Light. However
I'll never give in to humans!{06}{07}
Upon the burning Demon Tribe
blood of my birth Father, I will
rend the flesh from your bones
as revenge for my brother!{end}

My dark brothers 
and sisters, hear me!{06}{07}
The Descendants of Light
will not see the sunset this day.
Avenge our Dark Prince, B{3a}ser!{end}

{font3}Lord B{3a}ser shall
{font3}be avenged!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}We won't fear the 
{font3}Descendants of Light!{end}

Listen up, everyone!
We can't go easy on Sonya,
even if she is Rohga's sister!{06}{07}
Let's show them the power of
the newly awakened Langrisser.
Fight for our ideals. Let's go!{end}

Death to the putrid humans!
Yes, ... tear them to shreds!{end}

I'm counting on you!
Destroy the human scum!{end}

{font3}Don't tell me
{font3}what to do, bitch.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}I only followed you
{font3}in the past because
{font3}of a direct order
{font3}from B{3a}ser himself.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Now that he's dead,
{font3}I don't have to take
{font3}any of your shit!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Hmph ...!
{font3}We're gonna have
{font3}a little bloodbath!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}And you're cordially
{font3}invited, you
{font3}filthy, halfie bitch!{end}

N, no way!
You can't be serious ...{06}{07}
B, but we're friends,
aren't we ...!?{end}

{font3}Let's have at it,
{font3}Descendants of Trash!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}I shall avenge
{font3}Lord B{3a}ser!{end}

What the hell?{06}{07}
It seems the enemy
has divided into two factions.{end}

{02}, it seems she
brought backup! Sea Serpents
were hiding under water!{end}

Damn! Be wary near the river,
everyone! Aquatic monsters
can be quite powerful in water.{end}

You found a small locked box.
The outside has an inscription.{06}{07}

"Would you,
Knowing what's in store,"{06}{07}

"Memory relegated to lore,
Choose this life once more?"{end}

The small box turned
to rust and vanished.{end}

The box opens up
with a satisfying squeak.{06}{07}

You lift out the precious
gem from within the box.{06}{07}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

As you step into a thicket, a
chain coils around your feet.{06}{07}

Will you cut it off?{end}

The chain instantly turns
to dust before your eyes.{end}

You carefully remove
the chain using your hand.{06}{07}

Moments later,
it begins to sparkle.{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{end}

After a little while, a
large tree begins speaking.{06}{07}

"You ... human ... Will you
please unshackle that chain?"{06}{07}

"That bothersome metal has
encircled me for so long ..."{end}

Chop it off{end}

Remove it by hand{end}

Ignore the tree{end}

In severing the chain with
your sword, you injure the tree.{06}{07}

The large tree falls silent.{end}

Using your hands, you
courteously remove the chain.{06}{07}

"Thank you ... that chain was
a burden these thousand years."{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{end}

The tree gives up
and remains silent.{end}

What!?
You won ...?{end}

Uggh!
I never thought they
could beat me ...{end}

Horrible!
That hurts!{end}

Not bad ...
They knocked
me over ...{end}

Shit!
I'm beat!{end}

Arrgh ...
Can't win ...{end}

I'm sorry.
I'm going back ...{end}

Ugh ...
I can't do any more ...
I'm sorry ...{end}

My back hurts again.{end}

No ... no ... Why!?
This world hates me!{06}{07}
Even my demon tribe
allies turn against me!{end}

I won't die like
this, I can't die!{06}{07}
No one will help me,
I must survive!{06}{07}
Betrayed again ... Groan!
Get out of my way you
backstabbing assholes!{end}

You, ... you humans!{end}

Attack me if you will!
I won't let you kill me.{06}{07}
There's no way
in hell I'll die here!{end}

{font3}Die!{end}

Why!?
Why did this happen?{end}

Ooh ...!
This is wrong!{06}{07}
At this rate, I won't be
able to win against you ...{06}{07}
However, I'll never give up!
Humanity and those
treacherous demons will
perish by my hand!{end}

They're so strong ...{06}{07}
Incredible, Langrisser is ...
How could humans receive
such incredible power ...?{end}

Sonya, it's not the sword
that makes us strong.{06}{07}
We believed in each other,
helped one another, and
became a powerful force,
all without Langrisser!{end}

Sonya, it's not the sword
that makes us strong.{06}{07}
We believed in each other,
helped one another, and
became a powerful force,
all without Langrisser!{end}

Sonya, it's not the sword
that makes us strong.{06}{07}
We believed in each other,
helped one another, and
became a powerful force,
all without Langrisser!{end}

I'm so jealous ...
of you all ...
If I could live again--{end}

{font3}Damn! The tide has
{font3}turned, retreat!{end}

Sonya ...{end}

Sonya ...{end}

This is very heartbreaking ...{06}{07}
Her whole life, people
have abandoned her. 
There was no one
she could depend on.{end}

She never had the
chance to see the good side
of the human spirit ...{06}{07}
How sad ...{end}

{02}, let's make
sure her death is the
last of this war's tragedies.{end}

Everyone ... let's go!
To Velzeria!{end}

{font3}Your blood is tainted
{font3}with the putrid
{font3}stink of humanity!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Because of this, you
{font3}will be disposed of!{end}

{font3}Don't affiliate
{font3}with us any longer!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}You are the bastard
{font3}shame of our tribe!{end}

What ... Why!?
What's happening...{end}

{font3}Ugh, strong ...{end}

{font3}Not bad ...{end}

{font3}This is impossible!{end}

{font3}Gaahh ...{end}

{font3}Aarrgh!{end}

{font3}Ugh ...{end}

{font3}...{end}

{font3}Ooohhh--!{end}

{font3}Ooohhh ...!{end}

{font3}Destroy everything!
{font3}This is the
{font3}will of B{3a}ser ...{end}

{font3}I've heard that the
{font3}Descendants of Light
{font3}have incredible power ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}We must go about
{font3}this seriously.{end}

{font3}It's over!
{font3}Cease your futile
{font3}struggling.{end}

{font3}Gahh--!
{font3}I've been hit ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Cough ... Cough ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Wryyyyyyyyyy!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}You scum ...!{end}

{font3}Impossible!
{font3}You defeated the
{font3}Vampire Lord ...{end}

{font3}What is this!
{font3}You defeated the
{font3}Vampire Lord ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}However, now you
{font3}shall witness the
{font3}power of the first
{font3}family of the night!{end}

{font3}Ughh ...
{font3}Ooohhh--!{end}

{font3}Uuughh--!{end}

Ha ha ...
Heh heh heh ...{06}{07}
You'll never understand what
its like to be a half-breed.{06}{07}
What do you think its like
to be betrayed by all
those you trusted and loved?{06}{07}
I am always suspicious of
others ... But I guess there's
no need to worry now ...
I die a glorious child of Chaos.{end}

{font3}How interesting!{end}
