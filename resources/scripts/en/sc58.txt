Whew, this is taking forever.
Shouldn't we have
caught up by now?{end}

We shouldn't have given
them so much time ...{end}

Well, they're
fast at running away.
That's for sure.{end}

Their troops advance
too quickly. We haven't even
reached the rear guard.{end}

Are you certain
that's the case?{end}

This looks like a trap.
Lester and his navy would
excel on this battlefield.{end}

Ah hah. Just as I thought.
They've prepared an ambush.{end}

Damn ... I thought we'd catch
them off guard here,
but they've noticed us.{end}

Lester, I offer
you my thanks.{06}{07}
I don't know how to
repay your watching over
Jessica in my stead.{end}

Egbert, you've
really lost it.{06}{07}
How can you thank someone
who wants you dead?{06}{07}
Why the hell did you
even leave Jessica alone
in the first place!?{end}

To destroy the darkness.
That's why I left ...{end}

You helped Bernhardt
expand his worthless Empire
to end the darkness?{06}{07}
Why do I doubt that?{end}

Since B{3a}ser's resurrection,
I've pondered ways
to combat the darkness.{06}{07}
In the end, rather than gamble
on the Descendants, I settled on
a more tried and true ally.{06}{07}
I couldn't wait with Jessica
for them to show up, you see.
It was taking far too long.{06}{07}
Fortunately, my alternate
means succeeded to
a quite enviable degree.{06}{07}
Yet, we're not quite finished.
We must crush the remaining
rebels, including yourself.{end}

"Rebels!?"{06}{07}
This isn't a rebellion!
You're invading and pillaging
every town you come across!{end}

...{06}{07}
The continent is admittedly
raging with war.{06}{07}
But it is for a common
good. This war, this
conflict, will be the last.{end}

You've always been so smart.
Such a glib talker, Egbert.{06}{07}
But we're not ready to pack
it in. Hell, we've been pretty
good at "rebelling," as I see it.{06}{07}
You're avoiding the real issue,
namely that no one wants
you or your stinking Empire!{06}{07}
You ran from Jessica to start
a war so everyone would die
for your damned schemes.{06}{07}
If you really wanted peace,
you wouldn't take it by
getting everyone killed ...{06}{07}
Egbert, you fucking coward!{end}

Excuse me, are you done?{06}{07}
Such a crude, simple man.
I hope moronic
fantasies comfort you in death.{end}

What the fuck did you say,
you pony-riding ass!?{end}

{02}, we must first
breach their naval defence
and strike down Lester.{06}{07}
Without his command,
they may lose the will to fight.{end}

I agree with Leon.{06}{07}
We need to end this quickly.
Cherie and Jessica's troops
are broadening their lead.{end}

Move fast and strike
with a concerted blow.
Don't mess this up!{end}

Understood!{end}

Leave it to me!{end}

Okay, this is it!
Let's make em' fear
we salty sailors!{end}

Not yet!
Don't move yet!{06}{07}
We have a terrain advantage.
Stay on the defence and
keep them running in circles.{06}{07}
Hold them long
enough for Jessica to
make her escape.{end}

Don't you understand?{06}{07}
That's exactly my thinking.
But when they leave an
opening, we cut em' down.{end}

Please leave it to me!{end}

Damn Imperial solders!
You're not the bosses here, at
least while we're around!{end}

Fuck this!
Reinforcements!{end}

You guys!
Why are you all here ...{end}

We came as fast as possible
to protect Princess Cherie!{end}

Their heads will a
fine addition to
Kalxath's treasury!{end}

All right! You guys
take them from the rear.{06}{07}
We'll flank them
from both sides!{end}

All right! You guys
move to their rear and
roust em' out of hiding!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Hey, Egbert.
There's something
I'd like to ask you ...{end}

I don't mind.
Ask what you please.{end}

Up until now,
B{3a}ser's resurrection was
simply an omen.{06}{07}
"The world will
fall into darkness, ..."
because of him, presumably.{06}{07}
Well, I heard from Jessica
the reverse is true ...{06}{07}
B{3a}ser doesn't bring chaos:
chaos brings B{3a}ser. Only a
bloody world will awaken him.{06}{07}
What's your opinion?{end}

...{06}{07}
I agree with the theory.
His Majesty, however,
should not know this.{end}

Then why did you agree
to the Empire's conquest?{06}{07}
Did you want to
reawaken the darkness?{end}

Even if I'd known,
I wouldn't have
changed my decision.{06}{07}
El Sallia's strife, continued
indefinitely, would
surely bring eternal darkness.{06}{07}
However, we Imperials
believe our war
will end in lasting peace.{06}{07}
Compared to all the blood
in history, we're
making a small sacrifice.{end}

So you're saying your
invasion is justified?{06}{07}
In war, justice means nothing!{end}

Your beliefs are flawed.{06}{07}
Peace will never come
through forcing your ideology.
Mankind will always resist.{06}{07}
True bliss can only come
through mutual understanding.{06}{07}
That's my conclusion.{end}

You don't understand
the tenacity of darkness ...{06}{07}
While we're wasting time
killing each other, it's
laughing and biding time! {end}

Heh heh heh.{06}{07}
The Empire, of course,
is frequently underestimated.
But please, rest assured.{06}{07}
We ourselves
underestimate no one.{end}

You found a small locked box.
The outside has an inscription.{06}{07}

"Would you,
Knowing what's in store,"{06}{07}

"Memory relegated to lore,
Choose this life once more?"{end}

The small box turned
to rust and vanished.{end}

The box opens up
with a satisfying squeak.{06}{07}

You lift out the precious
gem from within the box.{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

As you step into a thicket, a
chain coils around your feet.{06}{07}

Will you cut it off?{end}

The chain instantly turns
to dust before your eyes.{end}

You carefully remove
the chain using your hand.{06}{07}

Moments later,
it begins to sparkle.{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{end}

Give up, Lester!{end}

You're kidding.
You think I'll lose!?{end}

Not bad, Lester ...
You really took your terrain
advantage into consideration.{end}

Uggghh ...
If I keep fighting ...
I'm really gonna die ...{end}

Fucking careless!
No excuse ...{end}

This wound is deeper
than I thought. I can't help it.
Time to retreat.{end}

It's lights out for you!{end}

I'm ... I'm tired.
Sorry, it's all up to you.{end}

I don't have time to teach
you weaklings how to fight.{end}

Grrr ...
That's it ...{end}

That's right,
feel free to fear me!{end}

When you disappeared
so suddenly ...{06}{07}
Do you know how much
Jessica grieved for you?{end}

...{06}{07}
Ideals can easily
separate people.{06}{07}
It was only a matter of time.{end}

Tsk! Too soft!{end}

Fall back!
Save your strength
for the next battle!{end}

I won't let you pass.
Your ambitions end here.{end}

Egbert!{06}{07}
With all your pondering,
the best you came up with
was continental war!?{end}

The answer is self-evident.
I have no interest
in further discussion.{end}

Idiot! Why didn't you give up
before you had to die?{end}

Ugggh--!{06}{07}
Heh heh heh ...
What a grave mistake.
Heh ...{end}

Lester ...{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
Darkness will be stronger
now than ever. Don't
you think that's funny?{06}{07}
Here we are fighting, and
you're thinking this
is the last time, this is it ...{06}{07}
But after your generation
comes and goes, things will
happen all over again.{06}{07}
No one ever listens to
history, and no one ever will.
What do you know ...{end}

Egbert.{06}{07}
I don't know whether
you've been right
or wrong in all this ...{06}{07}
But I've always thought
of you as a brother.{06}{07}
And as a brother ...
I'm asking you not
to fight Jessica, please.{end}

...{06}{07}
I can't promise anything
in that regard.{06}{07}
If Jessica opposes us,
my loyalty's with the Empire.{end}

Oh ... I should have known.
A typical response
from the great new Egbert.{06}{07}
I guess I'll never know why
you changed ... so much ...{06}{07}
Farewell, Brother ...
Don't ... worry, Jessica ...
you can take this ... asshole ...{end}

Don't worry, Lester.
We'll bring a world
without darkness.{end}

Is that right?
I'll hold ...
you to it ...{06}{07}
Oh fuck ... Hah hah ...
My eyes, I can't see.{06}{07}
Egbert, think it over ...
Don't say a damned thing ...
Just think, and let ... me die ...{end}

Lester ...{end}

That man stood toe to toe
with the Empire ... through
it all, he never ran.{06}{07}
You were a good
soldier and a formidable
rival, Lester.{end}

Not to break the moment or
anything, but this isn't really
the time to be sentimental.{06}{07}
If we don't leave now,
we'll lose our quarry.{end}

Damn right, I'm itching to
kick some more ass.
Let's move it, shall we?{end}

...{06}{07}
Farewell, my friend ...
and goodbye, my brother.{end}

Let's do this, guys!
I'll show the Imperials a
real god damned navy!{end}

You going to fight
or talk, punks?{end}

This can't be true ...
Me, ... dead?{end}

You're in my way!{end}

You fuck heads
want a piece of me?{end}

I didn't expect this ...{end}

C, cold ...
So cold ...{end}

Hit hard and don't let
them catch their breath!{end}

Shoot down those
pigeons in the air!{end}

I, I lost ...{end}

Uugghh ...{end}

Let's go, break through!{end}

Another life taken ...{end}

Uugghh ...
Is this the end ...?{end}

I'll fight to the bitter end!
My magical prowess
can overcome anything!{end}

I didn't know they
were so strong ...{end}

We have to break through
before they get into formation!{end}

Even Imperial soldiers are
only men, after all!
You won't defeat him easily!{end}

Nooooo--!{end}

Fuck all!
I need support, fast!{end}

At this rate ...{end}

Fuck, fuck, fuck!
I'm the last one left!{06}{07}
At least I won't be lonely
in Hell! Who wants
to come along? Step up!{end}

How is this possible?
M, my naval troops!?{end}

You think you
can take us with such
pathetic tactics?{end}

Shut up!
All men, charge!{end}

The reinforcements have
been killed ...
Impressive, {02}{06}{07}
You're really skilled
at leading your men.{end}
