Hmmm ... it seems the power in
Langrisser has finally dried up.{end}

That's to be expected.
The divine energy flowing into
the sword has been cut off.{06}{07}
Without the goddess of light
to supply it with her power,
it's little different from
any common piece of steel.{end}

I wonder if it's
really for the best ...{end}

Hey, I'm just glad
the war is finally over!{end}

Lord B{3a}ser!
We've come bearing good news!{06}{07}
We've eliminated both the
Empire and the Army of Light.
As a bonus, we also took out
Lushiris for getting in the way.{end}

Very well done ...
You served your purpose even
better than I had hoped.{06}{07}
Farewell, Sieghart, I hope you
enjoy eternal slumber in that
piece of scrap metal that was
once Langrisser!{end}

What ...? It shattered!{06}{07}
The Holy Blade, Langrisser ...{end}

Love and hope are no more.
With Langrisser smashed, this
world has no future ...{end}

With Langrisser gone and
only Alhazard remaining,
we have nothing to fear!{end}

Th, the sky ...
It's turning black!{end}

Behold, mortals!
This is Alhazard's power!
This my true power!{06}{07}
{font3}Ah hah hah hah!{end}

The sun ...
It's ... vanishing ...{end}

The animals of the forest and
the fish of the sea ...
Everything is fading away ...{end}

What will become of us ...?
What lies in
store for our future?{end}
