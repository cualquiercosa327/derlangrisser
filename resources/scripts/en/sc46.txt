We should be
seeing Baldea soon.{end}

It's just beyond
this village.{end}

Great! Let's hurry
ahead, then.{end}

Halt. Is the Imperial Army
using this village
as some kind of decoy?{end}

I don't understand
what he's getting at.{end}

Answer my question!
Do you plan to harbour your
army near this town?{end}

We are people of the
Rayguard Empire, and we are
simply passing through.{06}{07}
Do you have business with us?
If not, stand aside.{end}

Still you spite me, cur!
You will not disrupt
this village's peace.{06}{07}
I, Aaron, shall end your
warmongering. You will not
set foot on holy Baldea!{end}

Wait a moment, please.
We don't want to fight.
If you just let us be ...{end}

You would be
so insolent!
Have at you!{end}

Damn it, he seems
serious about this.{end}

Oh well, we'll kick
his sorry ass. He won't
impede the Empire.{end}

Settle down.
Let's try not to kill
without need.{06}{07}
If he sees our intent is
not to bring war here, he
may agree to let us pass.{end}

The red-haired commander,
what do you call yourself?{end}

My name is {02}.{end}

You have mysterious eyes ...
You don't appear to
be soldier of Rayguard.{06}{07}
Why have you decided
to aid the Empire?{end}

If we take control
of El Sallia, the
war will be over.{06}{07}
Union by power is
better than the
current state of things.{end}

A forced peace would
be a short peace.{06}{07}
Someone with more power
could end it, someone like you.
Is that really sufficient?{end}

Hmmm ...{end}

It's only natural{end}

You can't sway me!{end}

I don't know ...{end}

It's only natural.{06}{07}
He with the most power
would be the best suited at
securing this land.{06}{07}
The longer it takes to
unify this continent, the more
lives will be lost.{06}{07}
Only with power
can we lessen the number
of those sacrificed.{end}

I see ... In that case,
we free nations will
destroy your Empire.{06}{07}
Very few would agree to
surrender their property and
livelihood under martial law.{06}{07}
I will fight against you for
my ideals. We shall see whose
method is the better.{end}

Spare us the altruism.{06}{07}
Aaron, in my travels,
I have seen
the horrors of war ...{06}{07}
This world is bloody
with conflict.
We must change that now.{end}

So, you hate war, ...
yet you wage it for "peace."
You, Sir, are a hypocrite.{end}

I can't say my
means are perfect.{06}{07}
But this way, I never
see war as
completely purposeless.{06}{07}
If you have other options,
I'd like to know them.{end}

I see ... If your actions
lead to peace, I'll be
mistaken about many things.{06}{07}
Come, {02}, let's
see how you end wars!
En garde!{end}

Everyone, hold!
This moment is critical!{end}

They're only provoking
us to penetrate our defence.{end}

Wow ...
Such a coward ...{end}

They might be
preparing something.
Let's advance with care.{end}

Attack them.
They're not plotting anything.{end}

Is that so?
You might want to be
careful, {02}.{end}

I'll give it my all!
I'm taking the enemy
down in one strike!{end}

Shit!
Serpent Knights!{end}

They were hiding
under the water!{end}

A crafty one ...!{end}

What?
An ambush!?{end}

Don't pursue!
We'll take them with
a pincer attack!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

How unsavoury.
This will cause
grave damage.{end}

Don't just charge in.{06}{07}
How about, instead,
we retreat
and reorganise?{end}

Indeed, a forceful rush
would be ill-advised.{end}

A rusty metal plate
in a vacant lot has fallen.{end}

Will you inspect it?{end}

The plate emitted light and
became a beautiful shield.{end}

Obtained Odin's Buckler.{end}

The metal plate collapsed.{end}

The flow of water
seems to be different here.{06}{07}

Do you wish to examine it?{end}

You dip your hand into the
water and hit something metal!{end}

Obtained Crown.{end}

Hesitate no longer!{end}

Now that I'm here,
I'm tired ...{end}

Gaahh--!
What a mistake!{end}

You're very reckless
to turn your
blade in my direction!{end}

Shit ...
I'm done for!{end}

What ...!?{end}

Eeek, my face!
You've cut my beautiful face!
I won't forgive this!{end}

Leon!
Please, give me orders!{end}

What should
we do, {02}?{06}{07}
His ability is limited.
I don't think
he'll be of much use.{end}

That's true.
Should we have
him stand by ...?{end}

Will you have
him stand by?{end}

Leave this to us.
Please, stand aside.{end}

It's your call.
Just use him wisely ...{end}

I will not lose!{end}

Aaugh!
Leon ...{end}

Don't try the impossible!
Leave this to us and fall back!{end}

But ...{end}

Retreat! They're too good.
You're our guide to Baldea!{end}

Augh!{end}

Don't be so unreasonable.
We need you to
lead us to Baldea.{end}

Imperial Army,
my blade has
rusted with age ...{06}{07}
Consider it an
even match!{end}

If we back down,
Langrisser will be taken
by the Empire!{end}

Ugh, it's already no good.
Can we do nothing
other than fall back ...?{end}

Power alone
does not make you
a natural ruler.{06}{07}
Those sort of thoughts
are responsible for all the
fighting in today's world.{end}

You don't understand my
motivation, but there's nothing
I can really do about that ...{06}{07}
Time and history
will move on.{06}{07}
One day you'll remember my
words and regret, but,
by then, it will be too late.{end}

What you're doing now
will not build an ideal peace.{06}{07}
You sad people should turn
your interests elsewhere
and let us live as we please.{06}{07}
Remember, it's not too late.{end}

...{end}

This is our first meeting.
Try to think it
over until the next ...{end}

Is this my end ...?
Is it here ...?{end}

Charge!
Let's kick some
Imperial ass!{end}

Oh ho!
You have defeated me ...{end}

Our wave attack
cannot be routed!{end}

I, I can't make
it any farther!{end}

Impossible!{end}

Arrgh--!{end}

Save me from death ...
from death ...{end}

Do you revel in your
own power, Imperial Army?{end}

Goddess ... 
Lushiris ...
Aaahhh--{end}

Goddess, give me power
to fight the Empire ...!{end}

Line up with our
sea units and
charge the enemy!{end}

Yes!{end}

Defeat ill befits
our Company ...{06}{07}
But it shall complement
you quite nicely!{end}

Aaahh--!
Noo ...!{end}

Their main force uses
its mobility to take
advantage of weak points!{end}

We're advancing
on the enemy!{end}

Gahh ... I'm falling
from my dragon ...
Aaahhh--!{end}

I was beaten ...{end}

I can't believe you
have made it this far ...{06}{07}
The Empire is truly amazing.
Who else would appoint
a pack of selfish hoodlums
as its representatives.{end}

Be reasonable!{06}{07}
We are not some
power-mad aggressors!{end}

Is that what you think?
I didn't join a
nation of tyrants.{06}{07}
We cooperate only because
the Empire can and
will unite all of El Sallia.{end}

Wh, what!
Are the Serpent Knights
finished already!?{06}{07}
These guys can't
be taken lightly!{end}

Yes!{end}

It's over.{end}

A very moderate
commander, huh?{end}

What a guy. 
He reminds me a
little of myself.{end}

So our next stop is
going to be the lost castle ...{end}

All right!
Our destiny is only
a few steps away!{end}
