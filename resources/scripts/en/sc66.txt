Work quickly!
We will need this place as
well-fortified as possible!{end}

Our troops are
making the preparations
as you speak.{end}

The Empire has Alhazard,
{02} has Langrisser ...{06}{07}
They won't lay around.
They will crush us in one
vulgar display of power.{06}{07}
Really, is there
any way to win against
these odds?{end}

Don't count us out just yet.
We have a few
ideas up our sleeves.{06}{07}
But there is still
plenty of work to do.{end}

I do not imagine {02}
can defeat the Empire
very swiftly ...{06}{07}
And even twice this time
would not have been enough.{06}{07}
However, if we work as
one and cover our
weaknesses, we will prevail.{end}

Bernhardt and his
lackeys were nothing.{06}{07}
Taking down this
little fort will scarcely
require an effort.{end}

What!?
Th, they are already here!{06}{07}
How could this happen?
Did {02} defeat the
Empire with a finger snap!?{end}

Those are demons ...
What in the world ...
What is going on here ...?{end}

This is the heart of the
Descendants' operation.{06}{07}
B{3a}ser said to put our
grind into this battle.{end}

Hah, leave it to me!{end}

Don't go killing recklessly.
I have additional orders.{06}{07}
The maidens of light
and darkness are needed
to unseal Alhazard.{06}{07}
I will take Liana alive.
Remember that.{end}

I heard from B{3a}ser
you planned on
kidnapping the girl.{06}{07}
But how exactly are
you going about it?{end}

We will teleport her to
Velzeria with this rod B{3a}ser
has so generously provided.{06}{07}
Until that happens,
I will protect her from
any interference.{06}{07}
You can wipe out
these cretins with your arms
behind your back.{end}

All right, everyone got that?
Let us move out.{end}

So it has finally begun ...{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
First the Empire, now
you have joined demons ...
Your soul gets
blacker each day.{end}

{02}, your lineage
means nothing. You are a
deplorable excuse for a human.{end}

Liana is getting away.{06}{07}
Cut off her escape route.
After her, quick!{end}

Liana is getting away.{06}{07}
We cannot let her escape!{end}

That magician seems to
realise our purpose here.{end}

Everyone, protect
the rear exit. It is the
safest route for her.{end}

Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, {02}.{06}{07}
To be victorious, we must
first secure our
position inside the castle.{end}

Right. We should break
off a squad to halt Liana and
refocus our other efforts.{end}

Damn it,
they got away!{end}

We cannot let them
unseal Alhazard.{06}{07}
Goodbye, everyone ...
And, {02} ... I ...{end}

I won't kill you,
but you must come with us.{end}

Aaahhh ...
How could this happen ...?{end}

For Alhazard's liberation,
you must embrace your destiny.{end}

Step aside, Cherie.{end}

Never!
I will never give in!{end}

Uugghh ...{06}{07}
In the end, we still
couldn't break the
seal on Alhazard ...{end}

Sorry, I have failed ...{end}

Well, Kalxath's troops have
managed to scratch me.
That is fairly impressive.{end}

Damn ...
If I retreat here ...{end}

Don't worry.
Our job here is simple, just
kill everyone but Liana.{06}{07}
Hmph!
Hardly a challenge,
if you ask me.{end}

Yes, spare no
one except for Liana!{end}

I leave the rest to you ...{end}

{font3}Uuggghhh ...
{font3}That was no good ...{end}

{font3}Ugh ...
{font3}Damn humans ...!{end}

Jessica is preparing
for evacuation, too.{06}{07}
If we lose her, all
our efforts will have
meant nothing.{06}{07}
Everyone, make sure
she leaves here in safety!{end}

Thank you, Cherie ...{end}

All right, Liana.
There's not much time.
Let's hurry.{end}

Yes, Lady Jessica.{end}

I can't move any more ...
Liana, you go on ahead.{end}

Aaahhh--!{end}

Princess!{end}

I am sorry, Keith ...{06}{07}
We've lost this one.
Let's retreat for now.{end}

We must halt
{02}'s advance!{end}

Lady Jessica, I'm sorry.
I won't be able to
protect you any more.{end}

At, at this rate ...{end}

Princess, escape with
Liana and Jessica!{end}

Are you telling me
to abandon my castle?{end}

Are you telling me
to abandon my castle?{end}

It is just a castle!
Everyone has
already evacuated.{06}{07}
Retreat for now and
prepare a counterattack!{end}

But Keith!{end}

But Keith!{end}

I will stop this
invasion with my life!{end}

Lord Lester!
Please ..., please take
care of the others.{end}

Th, this is it ...{end}

Princess ...
Please leave here. Protect
Lady Liana and Lady Jessica ...{end}

Are you telling me
to leave you behind and
flee like a coward?{end}

Are you telling me
to leave you behind and
flee like a coward?{end}

I am ... done for.
Please, save yourself and
plan a ... counterattack.{end}

But Keith!{end}

But Keith!{end}

As long as the Princess lives,
I have no regrets ...{end}

Lord Lester.
Please ..., please look
after the others...{end}

For the honour of
Kalxath, bring peace
to this world!{end}

Arrgh!
N, not yet ...{06}{07}
We ... Kalxath ...
Can't give in ...{end}

K, Keith!{end}

K, Keith!{end}

...{06}{07}
Farewell, ... my friend.{end}

...{06}{07}
Farewell, ... my friend.{end}

I am so sorry, Keith ...
I ...{06}{07}
It's all my fault ...{end}

You shall not pass!
We are giving our
lives to route you here!{end}

Aaahh!{end}

The girl has died?
What the hell happened!?{end}

No!
Now that Liana has died ...,
Alhazard's seal cannot ...!{end}

Do not think you
can just barge on in!{end}

This is personal.
I'll make anyone attacking this
castle sorry they were born.{end}

If you want to enter
the castle, you will have
to get through me!{end}

I won't let this castle
fall to the likes of you! Die!{end}

My magic should
have been unstoppable ...
Ugghh!{end}

You must think you are pretty
great for coming this far.
Too bad you won't go further!{end}

I ...
I have not ...{end}

I'm plummeting to my death ...!{end}

If, if I only had
a little more power ...{end}

Now, Liana.
There's nowhere to run.{06}{07}
Be a good girl
and come with me.{end}

Why ...?
{02}, why have you
changed so much?{end}

Liana ...{end}

When we first met,
you were so kind ...
You hated war ...{end}

None of that matters now.
I won't give up my throne.{06}{07}
After I am done,
you will see what a destined
ruler can do.{end}

You have changed,
after all ...{06}{07}
The {02} I knew
would not take power and
become a tyrant ...{06}{07}
He would have faith that
everyone wants
to live free of suffering!{end}

Stop talking nonsense.
You are coming with me.{end}

What is that sound?{06}{07}
Langrisser is ... humming ...?{end}

What is happening?
{02}?{end}

What is going on?
{02}?{end}

What is this?
{02}?{end}

It is imperative that
you take Liana with you.{end}

Okay, everyone ...
Move out at once!{end}

...{06}{07}
I understand ...{06}{07}
Don't concern yourselves.
Fight to your heart's content!{end}

If I die,
the castle ...{end}

Here and no further.
They must not seize
the castle's interior ...{end}

No, it's nothing.{end}

Why would B{3a}ser's
underlings be here ...?{06}{07}
Perhaps, if they want ...
Yes, that has to be it!{end}

What is the matter?
Jessica?{end}

Liana, you must escape now.
Run! Go quickly as you can!{end}

Wh, what ...?{end}

B{3a}ser may be scheming
to exploit your ability in
unsealing Alhazard.{06}{07}
I will protect you
until you reach the exit.
Go immediately!{end}

All right, Liana!
Almost there!{end}

Yes!{end}

Leave the castle to us.
You must escape too, Jessica!{end}

...{06}{07}
Yes, understood.{end}

I am okay with leaving
the front line, but
not protecting Liana ...{end}

Everyone is
fighting for me ...{06}{07}
I cannot let them down ...
I won't be captured.{06}{07}
I have to hurry!{end}

You over there!
Come with me.{end}

No! Let go of me!{end}

Stop it!{end}

Liana, I am coming!
Hold on!{end}

Don't worry about escaping.
It is already over.{06}{07}
Watchers of time and space ...
Honour your ancient pledge
and send her to another land ...{end}

Sh, she disappeared ...?
Where could she have gone!?{end}

Great.
Mission accomplished!{end}

Now the seal
can be broken.{06}{07}
To conduct the ceremony,
we must head toward
the Underground Shrine.{end}

What is this sound?{06}{07}
Langrisser is ... humming?{end}

What is wrong?
{02}?{end}

...{06}{07}
Nothing.
It is nothing.{06}{07}
Our objective here is complete.
Everyone, prepare to depart.{end}

All your traipsing
around is driving me nuts!{06}{07}
No one should ever,
ever interrupt my nap!{06}{07}
Hmm? What is it?
Are you trying to tell me
you want something?{end}

You greedy fellows
irritate me to no end!{end}

Go ahead and take this.
Humble people are
very important, after all.{06}{07}
Now, if you will excuse me,
I am going back to sleep ...{end}

Obtained Dragon Scale.{end}
