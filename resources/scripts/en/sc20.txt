Your Majesty,
I must inform you of our
situation at the front!{end}

What ...{end}

Your Majesty ...?
Did we not hold back the
enemy long enough?{end}

Don't concern our Kaiser
with such petty matters.{06}{07}
I will hear your report ...{end}

Yes, Sir!
I'm sorry!{06}{07}
I have a report from
General Leon ...
He has let the enemy intrude.{end}

Really ...
In that case, we will ambush
them on their way in.{06}{07}
No matter what, we will
ensure His Majesty's safety.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

You are ...
You're Bernhardt!{end}

Indeed ...,
I am the Kaiser of the
Rayguard Empire, Bernhardt.{06}{07}
I must thank you for
being such excellent couriers
of my sword, Langrisser.{end}

He seems awfully
complacent for a man
cornered by his enemy ...{end}

Why should I be concerned?
We will have the last laugh!{end}

Bernhardt!
We won't allow the revival
of Alhazard!{06}{07}
We will stop you here!{end}

Oh, will you, boy?{end}

We're on the verge of
being able to toast to
a lasting peace!{06}{07}
Everyone, fight with
all your heart!{end}

Sorry for being late ...{06}{07}
It took a good deal
of sorcery to wear down
that garrison ...{end}

Impossible, you are ...!?{end}

{font3}Heh heh heh ...
{font3}{font0}Meddling sorceresses
should learn to stay dead ...{06}{07}
That's the problem with killing
worms--you cut them down,
but both halves keep wiggling.{06}{07}
But since you used the
Rebirth spell, I shouldn't
underestimate your skill, ...
{font3}Jessica!{end}

B{3a}ser ...,
Prince of Darkness ...
When were you revived?{end}

You know him?
He is the man who aided
me in obtaining Alhazard.{end}

Now it's all clear to me.
Only an absolute fool ... 
would cooperate with demons!{06}{07}
This is all B{3a}ser's scheme.
He's using you!{end}

Once again, I have
been resurrected!{06}{07}
And with the waking of
Chaos' Glory, darkness shall
once again rule this world!{end}

That won't happen!
We won't let Alhazard
be revived!{end}

Ah, the redheaded nuisance ...
Thanks to my men's reports,
I know all about you.{06}{07}
However, your ragtag
"army" will find reaching my
throne most impossible.{06}{07}
In time, you shall realise that
raising a sword against me
was truly reckless.{end}

Oh, really?
We will win this fight.
Wait and see!{end}

Hmmm ...
A humorous fellow ...{06}{07}
So be it, young warrior.
Show me what power you
think gives you the right to
make El Sallia yours!{end}

Bernhardt!
You've already lost.
Give up while you still can!{end}

Pathetic!{06}{07}
The Rayguard Kaiser
will never give up,
much less surrender!{end}

Fellow Blue Dragon Knights,
follow me to glory!
Avenge General Leon!{end}

Prepare yourself,
Descendants of Trash!{end}

On a pedestal
rests a blue potion.{06}{07}

Will you drink it?{end}

Magic Defence raised!{end}

On a pedestal
rests a red potion.{06}{07}

Will you drink it?{end}

Movement raised!{end}

Your schemes are over!{end}

That wasn't how I planned ...
Please, finish off
the Empire for me ...{end}

All the way to this day ...
Only to die ...?{end}

Sorry ...
I can move no longer ...{end}

Argh!
Lost ... before the Empire ...
How worthless ...{end}

I won't keel over
in a place like this!{06}{07}
Me heart's set on resting
in a saltier grave!{06}{07}
I think I'll be retreating
for now ...{end}

My old bones can't
keep this up ...{06}{07}
This battle's too important
for me to just step out, ...
but it can't be helped ...{end}

My training is a long way
from being sufficient ...{end}

Goddess Lushiris!{end}

Kaiser Bernhardt,
that man, B{3a}ser, is the
Prince of Darkness.{06}{07}
He gives away power
only to manipulate you.{06}{07}
The strength you've
acquired isn't from
Alhazard alone!{06}{07}
You're channelling the
energy of Chaos.
It will consume you and
destroy this world!{end}

So what if I choose to wield
the power of darkness?
As Kaiser, it's my prerogative.{06}{07}
Langrisser is no different.
Power is power--
its source matters little.{end}

Alhazard drives those who
wield it to madness!{end}

Such ignorance!{06}{07}
What is a sword but steel?
It is the fire of its wielder's
heart that forges its use.{06}{07}
Alhazard shall bow to me ...
As will this continent of
fools and fools' kingdoms!{end}

In that case, Kaiser,
we must dethrone you.{end}

You managed to get here.
I commend you for that.{06}{07}
But, you will soon witness
the difference between a
Kaiser and a few brash weeds!{end}

Damn, you're better
than I thought.{06}{07}
But don't think it's over!
Gwah hah hah!{end}

As I would expect from the
Descendants of Light!
But this time I was unprepared.{06}{07}
Next time will be
quite different.
Farewell, fools!{end}

It is the will of
His Majesty.{end}

Wait! Egbert!{end}

Ha ha ha!{end}

Egbert ...
You said you hated the
forces of evil.{06}{07}
Why have you ...{end}

Strange ...
Where could Alhazard be?{end}

It appears your reign is
at its end, Bernhardt ...{end}

B{3a}ser, a man of
your power is intimidated
by the Descendants of Light?{06}{07}
How ridiculous ...
You said they would
be easily dealt with.{end}

My dear Kaiser ...
Who said anything
about those worms?{end}

That's a waste.
I won't lose to them.{end}

Think you can beat me!?
The Descendants of Light ...
How pathetic!{end}

Again ...
Again I've yielded to the
Descendants of Light.{06}{07}
Arrgghh!{end}

Bernhardt!
You're next!{end}

Hah ...
This sounds like fun.{end}

What!?{06}{07}
{02}, that Bernhardt
is an illusion. The real
Kaiser isn't even here!{end}

What!
You mean that man is,
just an illusion spell?{end}

What does it mean?{end}

That's an illusion spell!{end}

Heh heh heh ...
Just as I expected, Jessica.{06}{07}
Right about now, His Highness
is preparing Alhazard's
glorious revival ceremony.{06}{07}
Thanks to you, we've had
all the time we could want.{06}{07}
Really, you have
His Majesty's regards.{end}

Egbert! Wait!{end}

Heh heh heh ...
As I would expect.{end}

That voice is Egbert's!{end}

Right about now, His Highness
is preparing Alhazard's
glorious revival ceremony.{06}{07}
Thanks to you, we've had
all the time we could want.{06}{07}
Really, you have
His Majesty's regards.{end}

It seems Egbert's
magic is responsible.{end}

Where is Bernhardt!?{end}

I wonder where the
Kaiser could be ...{end}

Bernhardt, ...
Where are you?{end}

Not bad ...,
not bad at all ...{06}{07}
But, I won't die
quite so effortlessly.{end}

Egbert ...!{06}{07}
That's enough, stand back!
Next time, leave it to me.{end}

I'm sorry, Your Highness.{end}

Aahhhh!{end}

As expected ...
But with your meagre ability,
you won't defeat His Highness.{end}

This can't be right ...{end}

I, I've lost?{end}

Why, why can't I win ...{end}

Protect his Majesty!{end}

Yeah!{end}

P, painful ...
I can't breathe ...{end}

I won't die yet.
I won't die ... not yet ...{end}

Aaahh ...
Bernhardt, Your Majesty!{end}

From the opposite pedestal
comes an ear-shattering sound.{end}

Perhaps ...
He may have gone to
the cursed land ...{end}

Chaos' Glory,
Alhazard ...{06}{07}
It sleeps in Velzeria's
darkness until the
Keeper of Alhazard awakes.
B{3a}ser ...{end}

By now, we're too late.
The prophecy is everything
but reality now.{end}

Velzeria ...
The forbidden land?{end}

We mustn't allow
Alhazard's revival!{06}{07}
The War of Elthlead
cannot ... the continent
cannot bear it again.{end}

The War of Elthlead?{end}

During my natural life,
before I returned with
the spell of Rebirth ...{06}{07}
There was a time when,
through the power of Alhazard,
evil laid flame to this world.{06}{07}
The Dark Blade's power was
fierce, and it forced us into
a terrible, tragic war.{06}{07}
Our good king of that time,
Sieghart, took his own life,
binding his essence within
a weapon to rival Chaos.{06}{07}
That sword became known
as Langrisser,
the Might of Elthlead.{06}{07}
We received Langrisser's
power and successfully
sealed Alhazard, ... but
many lives were sacrificed.{06}{07}
We must never allow that
disaster to repeat itself.{end}

What I will tell you
is also written in the
ancient scrolls.{06}{07}
"When the Dark One drew upon
Alhazard's unbridled power ...,
the sun was swallowed and
the stars vanished ..."{06}{07}
"The dead rose from the
cracked earth, and all life
was engulfed in a
world of darkness."{06}{07}
This, this really happened ...{end}

I cannot believe Alhazard
is capable of so much ...{end}

{02}, you must stop
Alhazard's awakening!{06}{07}
I will go ahead to
search out Alhazard's
revival ceremony.{06}{07}
The rest of you, please
depart for Velzeria.{end}

All right ...{end}

Velzeria lies across the sea.{06}{07}
A port city lies just
down the road.
We can find a boat there.{end}

There's a short cut to
Velzeria by sea.
Let's hurry and find a boat!{end}

I'll be one step ahead.
Let's all head to Velzeria.{end}

Lester, show us the way to
Velzeria, please.{end}

Liana ...{end}

You don't have to say
anything, I understand ...
I promised, didn't I ...{end}

I'll wait for everyone
to come back in one piece ...{end}

Liana, I'll go with
you to Kalxath.{end}

Thanks, Hein, but I'm okay.
I can go by myself.{end}

Well then, let's depart!
Liana, be careful.{end}

May Lushiris' light
guide us all ...{end}
