I, I can't believe it!{06}{07}
I would never have
thought our enemies
would reach this place.{end}

{02} is strong indeed.
Powerful enough to
make it this far.{06}{07}
But, he is nothing by himself.
He owes it all to the
Holy Blade, Langrisser.{end}

He may be strong with with that
sword, but our Kaiser forged
this country with his own hands!{06}{07}
We still have a chance!{end}

It's almost
time, isn't it?{end}

Yeah ...
All right, prepare
for the attack!{06}{07}
If we lose here, they'll be
able to enter the castle.{end}

The battle preparations
are complete.
They'll arrive any minute.{end}

Listen up!{06}{07}
This will be the finest hour
of the Blue Dragon Knights.
Now, our righteousness
must shine like the stars!{end}

Glory to Rayguard!{end}

Leon.{end}

You made it, {02}.{end}

Leon!{06}{07}
Do you really think that
using the power of evil will
bring peace to El Sallia?{06}{07}
Surrender!
There's no more reason
for us to fight!{end}

Hmmm, ... Hah hah!
You came all this
way just to say that!?{06}{07}
The Blue Dragon Knights
will never run nor hide!{06}{07}
Until the end, we will
fight our noble battle
with glory and honour!{end}

I can't stop him ...{06}{07}
His emotions are so
painful to hear ... {06}{07}
I can't ... stop him--
But ... I don't want ...
don't want to fight him ...{06}{07}
But--!{end}

You've come quite a
long way, haven't you.{end}

Egbert!{end}

I have something
interesting to show you.{end}

Jessica!{end}

This foolish sorceress
tried to lay siege to our
castle by her lonesome.{06}{07}
She underestimated
the wrath of Alhazard.{end}

Wait, Egbert.
I had no intention for such
an honour-less fight ... {06}{07}
To use hostages ...
It's disgraceful!{end}

This is between
me and {02}!{06}{07}
No matter what,
you won't interfere.
Don't get in my way!{end}

Hah hah hah ...
Temper, temper, Leon.
That's quite a weakness.{06}{07}
However, it serves you
well in the proper situation.{06}{07}
Fear not for your
almighty Code of Chivalry,
I will release this woman.{end}

Well then, I will prepare
the welcoming party.{06}{07}
Let us hope it turns out to be
an unnecessary precaution.{end}

Egbert ...{end}

Are you okay, Jessica?{end}

Uughhh ...{end}

Jessica!
Are you all right?{end}

Please relax.
We're doing fine
on our own.{end}

I'm sorry, {02}.
I'd probably just
get in the way. {06}{07}
For now, I'll fall back.
Good luck, everyone ...{end}

{02}!
Now we must attack
with all our might!{end}

Leon!
Why are you
fighting for this?{06}{07}
By releasing Alhazard's power,
Bernhardt beckons nothing
but destruction to this world!{end}

Please, Leon!
Stop this futile battle!{end}

I'm sorry, L{37}na ... {06}{07}
To pacify this war-torn
world, you need the
means to achieve peace!{06}{07}
Even if it's the 
power of evil!{end}

That's wrong Leon!
There's no such thing as
peace through power!{end}

...{end}

Leon! The ambush
preparations are complete!{06}{07}
We're ready to
fight any time!{end}

At last, the final
battle has come!{06}{07}
I'll offer you no mercy!{end}

Fool ...
Well, it can't be
helped, can it?{06}{07}
Everyone, let's go!{end}

Leon ...{end}

If we lose here,
we have no future.{06}{07}
Fight with all the
fury of your namesake!{06}{07}
You are the most
elite squadron in the
Blue Dragon Knights.{06}{07}
Battle with honour!
Hallow and praise our
Blue Dragon name!{end}

{02}!{end}

...{end}

I have nothing
more to say ...{end}

Leon ...{end}

Glory to the Empire
and the Blue Dragon Knights!{end}

Stop Leon!{06}{07}
Why?
Why must you
fight us?{06}{07}
If we join ranks,
we can end this.{end}

Truly, if we were to
become allies, we could
stop this war ...{06}{07}
But someday, quarrels will
renew, and blood will be shed.
Even if this conflict ends,
history will repeat itself.{06}{07}
Only an ideal unified
nation, one of potency and
stability, will bring any
hope of lasting peace.{06}{07}
And I swore, together with
His Majesty, to achieve our
dream of El Sallia's unification!{06}{07}
The Kaiser is the only
one who can do this.
This is the surest ...
the only path to peace!{06}{07}
In this plan, {02}'s
existence is a nuisance.{end}

Why ...
Why must you
fight like this?{end}

I don't want to wash
blood with more blood.{06}{07}
Who has the power
to bring about peace?
The Empire? {02}?{end}

...{end}

Let's go, {02}!
Mercy is useless.
Don't hold back!{end}

There is a bottle full of red
medicine hanging on a wall.{06}{07}

Will you drink it?{end}

AT raised by 1 point!{06}{07}

Somewhere else, the sound of
a bottle breaking is heard.{end}

There is a bottle full of blue
medicine hanging on a wall.{06}{07}

Will you drink it?{end}

MP raised by 2 points!{06}{07}

Somewhere else, the sound of
a bottle breaking is heard.{end}

Leon, ...
Will you listen to
no one any more?{end}

...{06}{07}
You know how I feel.
I can betray neither the
Empire ... nor His Majesty
Kaiser Bernhardt.{06}{07}
I will honour my vow
as a Knight and serve.
His Majesty till the end.{end}

Leon! There's no one
who's despises fighting
you more than I do.{06}{07}
Why must you
continue this fight?{end}

Truly, wars give birth
only to sadness.{06}{07}
But, if nothing changes, then
these wars will never end.{06}{07}
The Kaiser must unify
this continent and form
an ideal nation.{06}{07}
For that reason, this last.
battle cannot be avoided.{end}

You haven't noticed what
you're doing is wrong!?{end}

I was born to this
glorious Empire,
raised in this Empire ... {06}{07}
And through blood and valour,
I've become general of the
proud Blue Dragon Knights!{06}{07}
I won't turn my back on
the path I've chosen!{end}

Damn!{end}

Did we win?
What a tragic battle ...{end}

Is this the end ...?{end}

Hmph!{06}{07}
Your skills have
improved, {02} ...
But you won't get
through me!{end}

Ow!{06}{07}
That last blow ...{end}

Just like the 
Blue Dragon Knights!{06}{07}
Beat them, {02}!{end}

Damn!
I was unprepared ... {end}

Darn!
I have been whooped ...{end}

Noooo!
I'm sorry, {02} ...{end}

Not yet.
Just until ...
Until we stop Leon ...{end}

Don't push it!
Leave it to me.
Fall back, L{37}na!{end}

Leon ...{end}

Sorry, L{37}na ...{end}

I'm sorry ...
I'm so useless.{end}

I, I too ...
will assist ...{end}

Jessica!
Don't overdo it!
Leave this to us.{end}

Yeah! Jessica,
take a break!{end}

I understand ...{06}{07}
Everyone, please ...
Make sure Alhazard
is sealed ...{end}

Ah ...
Until we can take
back Alhazard ...{end}

Ugh ...{end}

This shouldn't happen ... {end}

Even if I must sacrifice
my life, I will defeat you!{06}{07}
Let's go, {02}!{end}

This is what I desire!{end}

{02},
it's over!{end}

You ... shall not ...
pass through ... {06}{07}
Ughhh ...{end}

Damn it!
Better than I expected ...{end}

Leon! Please retreat!{end}

Leon, retreat!{end}

You ... all ...{end}

Don't worry. At least
we can delay them.{06}{07}
In the meantime,
please take care
of your wounds!{end}

... {06}{07}
I understand.
I'm counting on you.{end}

Take care ...
Take care of our
beloved Empire.{end}

Don't die on me ...{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

...{06}{07}
I understand.
I'm counting on you ...{end}

Ugghh!{end}

This is it ...{end}

Leon ...{end}

Attack!{end}

Ugh!{06}{07}
I'll never see
His Majesty again ...{end}

Ugh ... Leon,
I'm sorry, ... {06}{07}
I guess I just don't ...
have what it takes ...{end}

Attack!{end}

Prepare yourself!{end}

Leon, ...
It looks like this is
the end for me....{end}

Laird!
I won't let you die!{06}{07}
Did you come here
to just to perish?
Don't die on me, Laird!{end}

I'm sorry ... {06}{07}
Please ...
with His Majesty ...{06}{07}
Achieve our dream ...
a land without war ...
and a grand ...
and mighty Empire--!{end}

I won't let you leave
the Knights before me!{06}{07}
Open your eyes, Laird!
Please, open your eyes!{end}

Again, I've lost
my closest friend ... {06}{07}
We must finish
this quickly.{06}{07}
Will it be us, 
or {02}?{06}{07}
Only one will live on.
Let us fight now, for all those
who have given their lives ...
in the name of our Empire!{end}

Leon ...{end}

General ... {06}{07}
It looks like this
is the end for me ... {06}{07}
Please ... 
with His Majesty ... {06}{07}
Achieve our dream ...
a land without war ...
and a grand ...
and mighty Empire--!{end}

Of course!{06}{07}
I won't give even an
inch of ground in this battle!
Even if it kills me!{end}

Ahhh!{end}

You think you our
elite squad will go
down that easily?{end}

Leon!{end}

Glory to the Empire!{end}

So, the noble and storied
ranks of our great
legion end with me.{06}{07}
I am the last ...{end}

Give up, Leon.
You've already lost!{end}

Ha!
How could a man like
you defeat my division?{end}

...{end}

I am the general of the
Blue Dragon Knights!{06}{07}
I will never
retreat from here!{end}

Please, Leon!{06}{07}
Stop it! I don't want to
fight any more with you!{end}

L{37}na ...
I love ... {06}{07}
No, I have no right
to say that ... {06}{07}
I will fight to the end!
For all who have died,
I will uphold the honour
of the Knights!{end}

Leon!{end}

This is the end!
Let's go, {02}!{end}

I promise you Leon,
I will bring peace 
to this age of war.{end}

Fool.{end}

He was stubborn, but ... 
he truly desired peace.{06}{07}
Poor Leon ...{end}

Even while B{3a}ser's
spell controlled me as
the Dark Princess ...{06}{07}
Leon was the only one who
treated me with courtesy ...
and who made me feel like
I was a normal woman.{06}{07}
There was no one in this
world more warm and caring
than he was. His heart truly
desired nothing but peace ...{end}

We must push forward ...
and finish this immediately.{end}

{02} ...
I can feel an evil
presence nearby.{end}

That's right! 
This place is ours
for the taking!{end}

Alhazard is beneath the
castle. It's likely to be in
an underground temple.{end}

Even from death's door,
I will not retreat!{end}

No way!{06}{07}
If Leon is killed,
who will protect the
Empire of tomorrow?{end}
