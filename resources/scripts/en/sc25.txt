Just beyond this
bridge lies the forbidden
soil of Velzeria.{end}

Those demons will think
twice before attacking us while
we hold Langrisser, I bet!{end}

Maybe so Hein, but you should
never underestimate your
enemies on the battlefield.{end}

I'll have to remember
that, Keith. But I doubt
anything will happ--{end}

Langrisser's seal is broken,
Descendants of Light. However
I'll never give in to humans!{06}{07}
Upon the burning Demon Tribe
blood of my birth Father, I will
rend the flesh from your bones
as revenge for my brother!{end}

My dark brothers 
and sisters, hear me!{06}{07}
The Descendants of Light
will not see the sunset this day.
Avenge our Dark Prince, B{3a}ser!{end}

{font3}Lord B{3a}ser shall
be avenged!{06}{07}
{font3}We won't fear the 
Descendants of Light!{end}

{font3}This time you will die!{end}

{font3}We will show our
demonic strength!{end}

It's that crazy demon-loving
witch from the village we
saved before going to Baldea!{end}

Listen up, everyone!
We can't go easy on Sonya,
even if she is Rohga's sister!{06}{07}
Let's show them the power of
the newly awakened Langrisser.
Fight for our ideals. Let's go!{end}

Death to the putrid humans!
Yes, ... tear them to shreds!{end}

What the hell?{06}{07}
It seems the enemy has
divided into two factions.{end}

You found a small locked box.
The outside has an inscription.{06}{07}

"Would you,
Knowing what's in store,"{06}{07}

"Memory relegated to lore,
Choose this life once more?"{end}

The small box turned
to rust and vanished.{end}

The box opens up
with a satisfying squeak.{06}{07}

You lift out the precious
gem from within the box.{06}{07}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

As you step into a thicket, a
chain coils around your feet.{06}{07}

Will you cut it off?{end}

The chain instantly turns
to dust before your eyes.{end}

You carefully remove
the chain using your hand.{06}{07}

Moments later,
it begins to sparkle.{06}{07}

Obtained Gleipnir.{end}

After a little while, a
large tree begins speaking.{06}{07}

"You ... human ... Will you
please unshackle that chain?"{06}{07}

"That bothersome metal has
encircled me for so long ..."{06}{07}

What will you do?{end}

Chop it off{end}

Remove it by hand{end}

Ignore the tree{end}

In severing the chain with
your sword, you injure the tree.{06}{07}

The large tree falls silent.{end}

Using your hands, you
courteously remove the chain.{06}{07}

"Thank you ... that chain was
a burden these thousand years."{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{end}

The tree gives up
and remains silent.{end}

{02}, it seems she
brought backup! Sea Serpents
were hiding under water!{end}

Damn! Be wary near the river,
everyone! Aquatic monsters
can be quite powerful in water.{end}

Let's go!{end}

What!?
You won ...?{end}

Now ...
show me your stuff!{end}

Heh!
I wasn't really paying
any attention, sorry!{end}

You're mean!
That hurts!{end}

You're doing quite well!{end}

I won't lose!{end}

Gah ...
I couldn't ...{end}

I'll show you the 
legendary power of the
Knights of Kalxath!{end}

Damn!
This is as far as I can
fight with you guys ...{end}

You think you stand a
chance against me!?{end}

Damn it!
You beat me!{end}

Return to
your netherworld.{end}

I'm very sorry,
I have to retreat ...{end}

Hey, B{3a}ser is dead!
Snap out of it already!{end}

Gah ... any more of
this would be futile ...
Sorry ...{end}

No ... no ... Why!?
This world hates me!{06}{07}
Even my demon tribe
allies turn against me!{end}

I won't die like
this, I can't die!{06}{07}
No one will help me,
I must survive!{06}{07}
Betrayed again ... Groan!
Get out of my way you
backstabbing assholes!{end}

You, ... you humans!{end}

Attack me if you will!
I won't let you kill me.{06}{07}
There's no way
in hell I'll die here!{end}

{font3}Die!{end}

Why!?
Why did this happen?{end}

Ooh ...!
This is wrong!{06}{07}
At this rate, I won't be
able to win against you ... {06}{07}
However, I'll never give up!
Humanity and those
treacherous demons will
perish by my hand!{06}{07}
To do this, I'll ask for power
from my lord and master,
the god of ruin--Chaos!{end}

Impossible ...
But I won't die like this ...{06}{07}
Chaos ... Chaos' power ...
He will help me destroy
this cruel, heartless world!{end}

Sonya! If you summon Chaos,
this world as we
know it will disappear!{end}

I don't fucking care
what happens to this
miserable world!{06}{07}
Humans hate me, the
Demon Tribe I thought my
friends now persecute me!{06}{07}
My brother is dead
because of this war.
I don't even have a home!{06}{07}
I don't care for this world,
I don't care if it's destroyed!
I hope you all die!
I hope this world dies!{end}

{font3}Damn!
This is bad,
everyone retreat!{end}

Sonya ...{end}

Sonya ...{end}

How sad to have your own
people turn against you ...{end}

After what Sonya said ...
We have to go
to Velzeria, but ...{06}{07}
Maybe we should follow
Sonya. If she awakens
Chaos, Bernhardt and
Alhazard won't even matter.{end}

But after what Sonya said ...
We have to go to
Velzeria, however ...{06}{07}
Maybe we should follow
Sonya. If she awakens
Chaos, Bernhardt and
Alhazard won't even matter.{end}

Will you continue
to Velzeria?{end}

All right, to Velzeria!
We will end Bernhardt's
ambitions once and for all!{end}

I am worried about the
Empire's actions, but right now,
Sonya's madness be stopped.{end}

{font3}Your blood is tainted
with the putrid
stink of humanity!{06}{07}
{font3}Because of this, you
will be disposed of!{end}

{font3}Don't affiliate
with us any longer!{06}{07}
{font3}You are the bastard
shame of our tribe!{end}

What ... Why!?
What's happening...{end}

{font3}Th, that's
impossible!{end}

{font3}Ugh, strong....{end}

Esto!{end}

{font3}I'm sorry ...
Sonya ...{end}

{font3}V, very good....{end}

{font3}Gaahhhh--{end}

{font3}Gah--arrghh!{end}

{font3}Descendants of Light ...
Strong enemies ...{end}

Osto!{end}

{font3}Ug--{end}

{font3}Ooh ...{end}

{font3}Grrrrr--!{end}

{font3}Destroy everything!
This is the
will of B{3a}ser ...{end}

{font3}I've heard that the
Descendants of Light
have incredible power ...{06}{07}
{font3}We must go about
this seriously.{end}

{font3}It's over!
Cease your futile
struggling.{end}

{font3}Gahh--!
I've been hit ... {06}{07}
{font3}Cough ... Cough ...
Scum ...!{end}

{font3}Interesting ...
You defeated Faias.. {06}{07}
{font3}However, now you
shall witness the
power of the first
family of the night!{end}

{font3}Ugh ...
Gaaah!{end}

{font3}Grrrr ...{end}

{font3}Ahhhhh ...{end}

{font3}We don't care about
your selfish grudge.{06}{07}
{font3}We want to kill the
Descendants of Light!{end}

{font3}Hmph,
you'd better win,
for your sake.{06}{07}
{font3}Otherwise, it will
be us, and us alone,
who will have the
fun around here.{end}

Ah, thanks for coming, friends!
Would you be so kind as to help
slay these meddlesome humans?{end}

{font3}Don't tell me
what to do, bitch.{06}{07}
{font3}I only followed you
in the past because
of a direct order
from B{3a}ser himself.{06}{07}
{font3}Now that he's dead,
I don't have to take
any of your shit!{06}{07}
{font3}Hmph ...!
We're gonna have
a little bloodbath!{06}{07}
{font3}And you're cordially
invited, you
filthy, halfie bitch!{end}

{font3}Oh ho ho ho!
That sounds like
such a lovely idea!{06}{07}
{font3}I don't give a rat's
ass about you either!{end}

N, no way!
You can't be serious ...{06}{07}
B, but we're friends,
aren't we ...!?{end}

{font3}We must concentrate
on the slaying the
Descendants of Light!{end}

{font3}Let's have at it,
Descendants of Trash!{06}{07}
{font3}I shall avenge
Lord B{3a}ser!{end}
