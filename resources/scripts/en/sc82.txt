This cave ...
It looks inhabited!{end}

Who could live here?
I wonder ...{end}

Investigating couldn't hurt.
Just be on your guard.{end}

Personally, I'm hoping
for a little excitement ...{end}

There's someone in there!{end}

Someone is coming!{end}

Who could it be?{end}

Probably just some stragglers.{06}{07}
I wonder why they're here.
This cave isn't exactly
on the beaten path.{end}

He's that guy everyone
keeps calling a maniac.{end}

I know I have a reputation
for saying whatever pops into
my head, but I'm at a loss here.{end}

I can't believe they caught
me this way ... and now they
are calling me a maniac ...!?{end}

What's a maniac?
Can you eat it?{end}

I can't believe I'm
hearing this!{end}

There seems to be some
dissension among them ...{end}

The old lady is
getting pretty hysterical.{end}

Old ... lady ...?{06}{07}
I'm going to kill you.{end}

Halt, villains!{end}

You won't be laying
a finger on anyone today!{end}

That's right evil-doers!{end}

For we are ...{06}{07}
The Golden Dragon
Youth Defence Force!{end}

We have joined forces
to stop nefarious deeds
and spread justice to all!{end}

Black Ranger is right!
We'll bring you guys to justice!{end}

Umm ...
Kindly explain to me again
why we are "maniacs" ...{end}

There's no reason to
waste words on villain scum!
We'll show you!{end}

Well, shall we win
another battle? This one
looks simple enough.{end}

The spandex-clad superheroes
seem to be challenging us ...{06}{07}
Do they really think they
can withstand our assault ...?{end}

You bad guys sure get
worked up over a little
name-calling, don't you?{end}

Hey, I heard that!{06}{07}
Now hear my fist as it
pummels justice into
your black hearts!{end}

No argument from me!{end}

All right, lets take
these guys out!{end}

Maybe this isn't
such a good idea ...
They're pretty strong.{end}

Let's take them to
the underworld, boys!{end}

Looks like my power's run low.
I need to ... power up!{end}

Leave it to me!
I'll protect you!{end}

That's right, my lady.
You have nothing to fear!{end}

Fast as fast can be,
you'll never catch me!
Warp ...!{06}{07}
I'll be back!{end}

What? She vanished ...
Quick, head for where
she was standing!{06}{07}
She may have left
something behind.{end}

Hee hee! This is fun!
Warp! Warp!{end}

"I'll be back."
What did she mean by that?{end}

Again, again, again ...
Warp!{06}{07}
What the hell ... is this?
Damn, it's not working!{end}

I'm coming to back you up!
Keep your spirits high!{end}

Yes! I understand!{end}

You've done well to come here.
Kaiser Circle, lend me strength.{06}{07}
Give me the power
to protect everyone!{end}

Whoa, more creepiness ...{end}

Kaiser Circle ...?{end}

That girl ...
You won't get near her!{end}

What?
Come on, you're a 24/18
Wyvern with bats.{06}{07}
You couldn't have stopped
us even on Scenario 1!{end}

Sh, shut up!{end}

You know, I'm sure
I'll be okay even
without you guys ...{end}

Let's get this over with!{end}

Gaahh--!
How wretched!
In this party ...{end}

I know I haven't mentioned
it before, but I've
dabbled a bit in astrology.{06}{07}
And, everyone, today is
supposed to be my lucky one.{06}{07}
So let's move already!{end}

The stars were right!
I'm totally kicking ass today.{end}

Hein ...
What are you talking about?{end}

It's nothing ...!
Well then, let's go!{end}

So, what about that
sword we're searching for? 
We better hurry this up.{end}

Maybe we should
get back to the real mission ...{end}

Weren't you just bragging
about how much you were
"kicking ass?"{end}

Err ... Heh heh, that's right.
Back to battle, everyone ...!{end}

Is this the end of Hein,
the sorcery prodigy from
the village of Salrath?{06}{07}
Farewell, cruel world ...!{06}{07}
Leon, please shine on
like the Magic Star you are!{06}{07}
Wait, ... what?
Who the hell made me
to say this ...?{end}

Sh, shut up!{end}

I didn't say anything ...{end}

To die in such a place ...{end}

I'm the one
doing the narration!{06}{07}
The aloof mercenary, Rohga.
He continues a daring search
for his younger sister.{06}{07}
Farewell, Rohga!
The world will miss ...
its strongest warrior.{end}

Stop with the
drama, already!{06}{07}
If we die in the middle of
nowhere, no one will be
searching for anyone!{end}

Sorry, sorry ...
I just need a break.{end}

You think I'd be
defeated here?{end}

General Leon of the Empire.
Many admire one who is strict
with himself, yet kind to others.{06}{07}
Farewell, Leon!
Young, noble, and ...
blue knight ...!{end}

Who's the champ ...?{end}

Am I ... finished ...?{end}

I knew it! We shouldn't have
messed with them and
their maniac power.{end}

Stop saying maniac!
I'm not a maniac, so don't
confuse me with one!{end}

Step down! I can't let you
lose in a place like this!{end}

Boy, you're too kind ...{end}

What's this ...?
Am I the only one left!?{06}{07}
Was my command range always
this bad? Did my Creator ...
Did he even look at the FAQ!?{end}

Heh heh heh ...
You'll never know!{end}

I can't lose ...
For everyone, for my sister's
sake, I must not lose!{06}{07}
The player on the left ...
is he who controls the world!
Arrow Telios!{end}

You guys have no chance!
Just give up!{end}

I'll never give up!
Here is ... my Ultimate Blow!{06}{07}
Wind and Rain
Elemental Arrow!{end}

Hey Sis, I need
to take a little rest.
Is that okay ...?{06}{07}
Bye Mr. Dragon ...
someday ... someday again ...{end}

It's time to put my
power to use! Aaarrggghh!{end}

Gaaahh--!
I've been injured!{end}

Are you all
right, Kerberos?{end}

No, there's no other choice.
I must use my secret technique!{end}

Take care!{end}

Will I be okay by myself?
{end}

I knew it was useless ...
Okay, my secret technique!{end}

Well then, time to go!{end}

Ooohh ...
Don't tease me ...{end}

{02} ...
It ... hurts.{end}

Hein ...
It ... hurts.{end}

Rohga ...
It ... hurts.{end}

Leon ...
It ... hurts.{end}

Imelda ...
It ... hurts.{end}

Shit! Not bad, not bad!{06}{07}
But you're in trouble now!
Kerberos, Sorcerer, everyone!
Go for it!{end}

Man, the battles lately
have been a real pain.{06}{07}
Take this!
Typhoon Bolt!{end}

What's wrong, squirt?{end}

Don't screw with me!
Let's see what
you've really got!{end}

Don't like fun at your expense?
Well, maybe my leet
skills will entertain you!{06}{07}
Secret Technique:
Ascending Super Spiral ...
of the Hurricane!{end}

Take this!
Typhoon Bolt!{end}

You, you fiend!
Do you think to beat me?
I'm a champion of justice!{end}

My name is Ishida,
and none of you forget it.{06}{07}
Ishida, the Battling Champion.
I bid you farewell!{end}

Not bad, not bad!{end}

Grrr ...
What reckless fools would
challenge me!?{06}{07}
Die by my signature move ...
Mach Uppercut!{end}

I wouldn't want to hurt
a babe like you ...{end}

Aww, isn't that sweet.
Are you hitting on me?{06}{07}
Sorry honey ...
but I just want to be friends!{end}

Ow, what pain!
You really are merciless ...{06}{07}
But before you make up your
mind, at least take a look at
my ultimate moves!{06}{07}
Let's end this right now, lady!
Hyper Speed
Lavender Splash!{end}

Goodbye everyone.
See you later ...{06}{07}
Farewell, young warriors ...{end}

I can beat you guys
with my right hand alone.{06}{07}
To be honest, I kind of have to.
My left hand is only
for holding my head ...
Such is the life of a Dullahan.{06}{07}
Don't blink!
This next move is my family's
succession technique ...{06}{07}
Ultra Sword Slash
Rolling Thunder
Secret Strike!{end}

Step aside!{end}

Impossible. I've promised
a good friend otherwise.{06}{07}
But I will let you have
a taste of my true power!{06}{07}
Secret Strike
Engetsu Kagizaki!{end}

Endgame ... You think your
pitiful attacks can succeed?{06}{07}
Then observe my
god-like defence!{end}

Ugh ... It seems you
have beaten me ...{06}{07}
Farewell, Tiger ...
You always were ...
the king of the jungle ...{end}

Damn! I must ...
maintain my godly defence!{end}

You asked for it ...!
Venom Blade, activate!{end}

Hmmm ...
I'll settle this fight ...{06}{07}
This next move will
prove my genius!{06}{07}
Observe!
Cosmic Magnum Ray!{end}

Hmmm ...
You're fairly skilled.{end}

What the hell?
A barrier of spirit energy!?{end}

Hah hah!
This will be your grave!{06}{07}
Your attacks are
futile against us!{end}

Hah hah hah ...
Your power level is
weak, old man!{06}{07}
You thought you could
trap me in this pathetic
little barrier ...?{06}{07}
{font3}Grrrr-aaarrgghh!{end}

What!?
You can raise your power
level that quickly ...?{end}

Damn right, I can!{06}{07}
Talk all you want, in five
minutes I'm sending you to
the next dimension!{end}

No matter how I'm injured, ...
I won't give up.{06}{07}
Take my final attack ...
Super Star Smash!{end}

Beep ... Beep ... Beep ...{06}{07}

This is a message from the
Masaya broadcast system ...{06}{07}

We know this scenario is a bit
short, but thanks for playing it.{06}{07}

We appreciate your support!{06}{07}
To tell you the truth,
the Golden Dragon Youth
Defence Force's world is
incredibly important.{06}{07}
Their alternate dimension is
where the Masaya staff
masses its army of plastic
soldiers for world conquest ...!{06}{07}

{font3}Mwa hah hah hah!{font0}
{06}{07}

Now then, we return you to
your regularly scheduled game!{end}

There seems to be something
in a hollow under the floor.{06}{07}

Will you look at it?{end}

Obtained Assault Suit.{end}

Nooo--!
Not Shady too!?{end}

How depraved ...
To be taken down
by Imperial scum!{end}

Argh! It's hopeless!{end}

Radical Princess
Dark Power ...
Make up!{end}

Beautiful shield-bearing girl,
Radical Princess! In the name
of the heavens, I'll punish you!{end}

What?
How did she transform?{end}

Eh, what was that?{end}

Whoa! How cool!
I want to learn that!{end}

You'll have to wait
for puberty, kiddo.{end}

Radical Princess,
your transformation
won't save you now.{end}

Hah hah! Heaven will
punish evil-doers like you!{end}

I'll show you the power of love!
Playtime is over, Empire!
Grant me power!{end}

Gaaahhh ... How can ...
How can justice lose!?
Goodbye, cruel world!{end}

Ding dong! The witch is dead!
Which old witch?
The justice bitch!{end}

What the hell are you
talking about, {02}?{end}

That was fun!{end}

I'm feeling a
little tired ...!{end}

We've already
wasted too much time.
Let's hurry ahead.{end}

All right then!
Onward to Castle Baldea!{end}

Hey wait!
Don't run away!{end}
