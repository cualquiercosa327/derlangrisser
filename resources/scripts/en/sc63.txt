Hmmm, ...
I see I have returned
with good reason.{06}{07}
The preparations are complete.
Here, Rayguard must
offer its greatest defence.{06}{07}
{02} ...
To betray our Empire, you
are bold, if nothing else.{end}

Forgive me, Egbert.
I was unable to rally
them to our cause ...{end}

Does Langrisser really
pose such a threat?
It's just a sword, after all.{end}

Langrisser grants the
sum of light's
strength to its bearer.{06}{07}
Its potential is unlimited,
or so say the legends.{end}

Ah! You have come.{end}

Yes, I've come for Rayguard.
Sadly, you're on the wrong end
of Langrisser's vengeance.{end}

Four Heavenly Dragons against
a weakling and his pet sword?
I like these odds.{end}

Ever heard of
quality over quantity?{end}

Idiot. We possess history's
greatest generals and army.
Prepare for your execution.{end}

Interesting words.
Show me what Rayguard can do
aside from empty boasting!{end}

Our armies differ greatly
in power and endurance ...{end}

Hee hee hee!
Looks like you could
use a hand!{end}

What? That voice ...!?{end}

Long time no
see, big brother!{end}

Sonya ...
Why are you here?{end}

In a nutshell,
I'm here to help you take
down the Empire.{end}

Why are you assisting us?{end}

Sonya?
What are you doing here?{end}

B{3a}ser ordered us
to ally with you.{06}{07}
His order made me so happy!
I get to be with brother Rohga!{06}{07}
And {02}, the redhead?
B{3a}ser told me all about you.
Now, let's have some orders!{end}

Sonya joins the entourage!{06}{07}

Esto joins the entourage!{06}{07}

Osto joins the entourage!{end}

So this is B{3a}ser's idea?
I guess we'll deal
with that later.{06}{07}
Right now, let's focus on
finishing off Rayguard.
Everyone, work together.{end}

So now B{3a}ser has betrayed us.
I always did find
him untrustworthy ...{end}

Three platoons will not
breach this castle, fools.{06}{07}
Men, show no mercy.
Let them know how
we deal with traitors.{end}

Traitors will not
go unpunished!{end}

{02} doesn't have many
friends left. Such a
delicate force he's brought ...{06}{07}
I guess they all
want to die.{end}

Don't underestimate him.
It's true, we Heavenly Dragons
possess the Imperial Army.{06}{07}
But we must consider both
Langrisser's role in this battle
and B{3a}ser's support.{end}

Don't underestimate him.
It's true, we Heavenly Dragons
possess the Imperial Army.{06}{07}
But we must also consider
Langrisser's role in this battle.
It has impressive potential.{end}

Hmph ...
Yes, these are worthy thoughts.{06}{07}
But rest assured, we
will repel this
reckless invasion.{end}

The wielder of Alhazard
can confer great strength
to demons and monsters.{06}{07}
We must not allow it to
fall to the Demon Tribe.{end}

But Alhazard should
be in His Majesty's
possession right now.{06}{07}
There's no one it
would be safer with.{end}

But His Majesty holds Alhazard.
With his protection, there's
probably no need for concern.{end}

B{3a}ser, Prince of Darkness ...{06}{07}
I'm certain this is just
another checkpoint in
his grand scheme.{06}{07}
The Empire must thwart
his worthless fantasy.{06}{07}
Our ideals can prevent
a nightmarish world!{end}

Something seems to be
stuck in a hole by your feet.{06}{07}

Will you search the hole?{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

I will defeat Bernhardt and
become a supreme ruler.
You weaklings only hinder me.{end}

Let us pass, Leon!{end}

Hah hah hah.
You really are mad.{06}{07}
Do you think I will
stand aside, let you through,
just like that?{end}

No, I see this won't be easy.
We're going to
break your ranks instead.{end}

Well, well.{06}{07}
I am the renowned commander
of the Blue Dragon Knights, and
from history, I can say this ...{06}{07}
I do not fall easily,
and neither do my men!{end}

Damn ... Damn Langrisser!
The legends must be true ...!{end}

Argh, damn this!{06}{07}
I knew we couldn't stand
against all of the
Empire's finest at once ...{end}

You pest!{end}

Brother!{end}

Damn it!
I've slain a hundred men,
and I screw this up?{end}

Big brother,
watch what I can do!{end}

The Empire's time is over.
You are nothing but relics that
should burn in Hell!{end}

The Army of Darkness ...
Did they plan this betrayal
from the beginning?{end}

Master B{3a}ser serves no one.
We had only our reasons for
cooperating with the Empire!{end}

Are you okay, Sonya!?{end}

Sorry, I'm, I'm wounded ...
Permission to retreat!{end}

{font3}B{3a}ser ... requests
that we aid you.{end}

Esto!
Everything all right?{end}

{font3}Oooohhh ...!
Wounds are so painful ...
I'll step back ... for now.{end}

All right, Osto.
Remember this and think of
your glory to come!{end}

{font3}I understand ...
I will kill everyone who
opposes the master.{end}

{font3}Ooohh--!{end}

{font3}Beaten by
lowly humans.
Arrgghh ...!{end}

{02}!{06}{07}
I don't know what
you're trying, but it won't
happen with three commanders
and a few men.{end}

With Langrisser in
hand, uniting the continent
is no longer a dream.{06}{07}
I have the means to rule.
Now, all that remains
is to remove the Empire.{06}{07}
You always had the power,
but never the support.{06}{07}
After destroying you, the
independent nations
welcome us or bow down.{end}

It's true, if you three alone
defeated the Empire, then
all would willingly capitulate.{06}{07}
But such fantasies
exist only in
your addled brain.{end}

So we're harmless, then?
Let us test that theory.{06}{07}
I know you want Langrisser.
Just come and get it.
It's right here.{end}

Oh ...?
I guess it's best if
you keep quiet.{end}

Damn you, B{3a}ser.
What exactly are you
trying to accomplish?{end}

The resurrection of
Alhazard, perhaps?{06}{07}
We, after all, hold both
the Dark Blade and Dark Rod.{end}

Damn, so you're intending
to unlock Alhazard's evil?{06}{07}
One more reason to
make sure you
do not leave here.{end}

Oh, oh no ...
I ... Uggh--!{end}

Arrghh ... So vicious ...
You're not a
saint, that's for sure ...{end}

No one betrays
the Empire!{end}

Uugghh, at this rate ...
We'll ... Argh--!{end}

Step down, Laird.
I'll take care of this.{end}

Yes, Sir ...
My apologies.{end}

Oh hoh hoh.
Such arrogant little boys.{06}{07}
It's time for
your punishment!{end}

Remember this
on your way to Hell!{end}

I never liked you, {02}.{06}{07}
And I'll take revenge
for Zorum right here.{end}

I cannot die yet,
not in a place like this ...{end}

Do you think
the Sword of Light
is a mere toy?{end}

So B{3a}ser betrayed us.{06}{07}
I suspected it would happen,
but why now ... He could not
have chosen a worse time.{06}{07}
It is a certainty.
His goal is Alhazard
and nothing else.{end}

So you have Langrisser.
Let's see what it can really do.{end}

We must let B{3a}ser
know that Alhazard's seal
cannot be broken.{06}{07}
But do not forget,
we must return
to His Majesty alive ...{end}

What the!?{end}

With Langrisser's might,
and B{3a}ser's allegiance ...
Damn you, {02}.{06}{07}
I must inform
His Majesty of these
developments.
I can't die here.{end}

Our glorious capital ruined ...
Those wretches will pay
for this with their blood!{end}

My aerial kill technique ...
It never fails.{end}

So, {02}, you have
three halfwit commanders
and a few dozen men.{06}{07}
And you're planning to lay
siege to the capital,
the stronghold of Rayguard?{06}{07}
Hah hah hah hah hah!
You can't pay for this
kind of entertainment.{end}

Arrrgghh--!{end}

Uuugghhh--!{end}

For glory ...
and honour ...{end}

All rebels ... must die!{end}

My magic is ...
far stronger than this ...!
Aaarrrggghhh--!{end}

This is too convenient.
Why have you decided to
betray the Empire?{end}

Hee hee hee ...
It's Master B{3a}ser's orders.{06}{07}
B{3a}ser only cooperated
with them to get
Alhazard unsealed.{end}

Alhazard ...!?{end}

Are you okay?
Sonya?{end}

Are you okay?
Sonya?{end}

Oh, ... I'm fine.{06}{07}
We can't give up any ground
or we won't stand a chance.{06}{07}
The Demon Tribe will create
a brand new world free from
hatred and oppression ...{06}{07}
Until then, we have
to hold on and fight!{end}

How about that!
You recognise our
superior strength?{06}{07}
If you were a little quicker,
you might have lived.{end}

Obnoxious scum!{end}

Sonya ...{06}{07}
I've been searching ever
since the day you disappeared.{06}{07}
I had to return home on a job,
but there wasn't a damn thing.
Just a blasted wasteland.{06}{07}
When the fighting started,
you ran off without a word ...{end}

I'm sorry, Brother.
I really had no
choice back then.{06}{07}
Everyone was dying ...
Since Brother was so busy far
away, no one protected me.{end}

One more thing, Brother!
Didn't you and your friends
try to capture me?{end}

I granted permission.
We were hoping to help
you change your mind.{06}{07}
Will you ever give up your
grudge against humans, Sonya?{06}{07}
I'm sorry if you were hurt
by my lack of discretion.{end}

If Brother fights for our cause,
I won't worry about
his working with humans.{end}

What about at the village
a while back? Why did you
decide to run away?{end}

Because ...
Brother showed up allied
with humans ...{06}{07}
Master B{3a}ser would
have been angry with me
if I acted freely.{end}

I was always worrying
about my Brother ...{end}

Hmph, well, no worries now.
From here on, we'll
always be together.{end}

All right! 
I get to fight alongside
big brother Rohga!{end}

By the way, since B{3a}ser
directed your assistance here,
can you tell us about him?{end}

Ah, I see ...{06}{07}
So you used the Empire
to help B{3a}ser find Alhazard?{end}

Are you all right, Sonya?
Pull yourself together!{end}

Uugghh ... Brother ...{end}

How careless of me ...{end}

I'm sorry ...
I've failed, Brother.{end}

Are you okay?
Pull yourself together!{end}

S, sorry ...{end}

Don't say that.
Your help turned this
battle to our favour.{06}{07}
Thank you.{end}

Thank you ...
for your words ...{end}

So you're here because
B{3a}ser willed it?{06}{07}
Then, please.
I'd like you to tell
me about B{3a}ser.{end}

Oh? So you used
the Empire to
help you find Alhazard?{end}

Now, we will put an end
to Bernhardt and
take back the Dark Blade.{06}{07}
Sonya, Esto, and Osto,
your help is appreciated.
Together, we will succeed.{06}{07}
Victory will be ours!
On to Castle Rayguard!{end}

B{3a}ser is the master
of the Demon Tribe.{06}{07}
The world may know him
as the Prince of Darkness,
but he's a very kind person.{06}{07}
He saved my life and
looked after me ...{06}{07}
He treats the Demon Tribe with
compassion, and he once told
me there is no reason for war.{06}{07}
To bring peace to
humans and demons, he
needs the sword to govern
the darkness, Alhazard.{end}

B{3a}ser holds one secret
to unlocking Alhazard's seal.{06}{07}
And I believe the
Kaiser possesses Alhazard
and the Dark Rod.{end}
