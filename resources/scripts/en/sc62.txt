It's true, then.
Sonya has turned
against us?{end}

{font3}Yes ...{end}

It seems mere humans
cannot fully embrace
the darkness.{06}{07}
As for her father,
I should have 
killed him sooner ...{end}

Is Sonya dead ...?{06}{07}
Hmmm ... How disappointing.
She was of far
less use than I'd hoped.{06}{07}
But, she was sired
by her traitor of a father.{06}{07}
In fact, she's probably
meeting him as we speak.{end}

B{3a}ser! What were you
talking about just now?{end}

Heh heh ...
So you heard ...{end}

You ...{06}{07}
You murdered my father!?{end}

You're talking bull!
You think human lives
are worth nothing?{06}{07}
I'll never forgive you!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!{end}

B{3a}ser, you bastard!
Are you saying you
murdered Sonya's father!?{end}

Hmmm ...
What if I did?{end}

You worthless scum ...
I'll take revenge for Sonya!
I'm gonna beat your ass!{end}

You can't escape
this time, B{3a}ser!{06}{07}
Your ambition ends here!{end}

Hmph ...!
I won't be defeated
by mere insects.{end}

B{3a}ser, I allowed the
Dark Blade's resurrection
for the Empire's benefit.{06}{07}
I see it's been well cared for.
You have our thanks.{end}

Hah hah hah ...
How amusing.{06}{07}
Alhazard is mine alone!{end}

It certainly is ...
at least for the moment.{06}{07}
We shall reclaim
Alhazard for His Majesty!{end}

Interesting, ... the ceremony
has weakened me, but
you will not take Alhazard.{06}{07}
I will savour its
power for all eternity!{06}{07}
Go, my dark servants!{end}

Incredible ...{06}{07}
How were you able to
summon such a monstrous army
with one word ...{end}

Do you see?
This is Alhazard's power!{06}{07}
Do you really think you
mere humans can
compare to Chaos's Glory!?{end}

We've been through
far worse than you.{06}{07}
And don't forget,
we have Langrisser.{end}

Don't make me laugh.{06}{07}
Your worthless, incomplete
Langrisser shall
wither before Alhazard. {end}

I know not how our might
compares with the Descendants
you fought in the past.{06}{07}
We will just have to find
that out with our swords.{end}

Well then, you'd better
try your hardest!{end}

I admire that you've
reached the darkest
core of Velzeria ...{06}{07}
But this is not a
place for mortals.{06}{07}
And setting foot here has
sealed your death.{06}{07}
Come, my servants!
Play with them all you like.{end}

Grrrr ...
Persistent bastards.{06}{07}
Langrisser offers
humans such power ...{end}

Is that the best excuse
you can come up with?{end}

It's quite a miracle
that you've come this far.{06}{07}
But try any more and
suffer a pointless death.{end}

We'll see about that!{end}

Give up and crawl
back to your darkness!{end}

I am a god!
Humans are
nothing to me!{end}

Wait, {02}!
Let me avenge ...
Sonya's death!{end}

You bastard ...
Toying with humans like
they were nothing!{06}{07}
For Sonya,
you deserve to die!{end}

In your ideal society,
the powerful give control
to the weak ...{06}{07}
So you wish to be El Sallia's
wet nurse, {02}?
Hah hah hah.{end}

Leave this world, B{3a}ser!
The sooner, the better.{end}

The world doesn't
need the likes of you.
Leave now, forever!{end}

Damn it!
This world will be covered
in darkness ...{end}

I'm much stronger now!
There's no way I'll lose!{end}

God or not, we can grind
down any foe with persistence.{end}

Damn it!
Why now of all times!?{end}

Move! I have no
business with you!{end}

You've manipulated
Sonya all along!{end}

Sonya suffered greatly
because of you.{06}{07}
Accept your atonement!
You will pay with your life!{end}

How pathetic ...{end}

What fools ...
Sonya has always
detested humans.{06}{07}
Our goals aligned,
and I exploited that.
Nothing else.{06}{07}
However, if you're intent
on despising me,
you should know this ...{06}{07}
I was the one
who spread the plague
to your village.{end}

Sonya had to die ...
All because of you ...!{end}

Oh, is your dear
little sister dead?{06}{07}
Hah hah hah ...
I hadn't noticed.{end}

What did you say,
you son of a bitch?{end}

Never mind that.
I'll tell you something
really interesting ...{06}{07}
I was the one
who spread the plague
to your village.{end}

I don't give two shits
about you being a dark god.
You're still going to die!{end}

Sonya ...
You've spelt the end
for B{3a}ser!{end}

Leave it to me, Brother.
We must try to stop this!{end}

Sonya, you've grown strong.
I have plenty of faith in you.{end}

B{3a}ser ...
Do you want to die
by my hand ...?{06}{07}
{02}, please!{end}

{02}, sorry,
but I'm going to sit
the rest of this one out.{end}

You've done enough.
Relax and watch
a decisive victory.{end}

I know you've been pulling the
strings, dragging nations
into meaningless bloodshed ...{06}{07}
But now we'll
destroy you and purge
this world of evil!{end}

Amusing ...
You really think you
can defeat me?{06}{07}
A few worthless humans
will accomplish nothing!{end}

The God of Chaos ...?{end}

I am the final death,
the dark Omega.{06}{07}
My presence heralds
the end of humanity.{end}

That's what you think?{06}{07}
Humans won't die so easily.
When you push, we shove, and
there's plenty of us to do it.{end}

Uugghh--!
What a blunder ...{end}

Hmph ...!
Get out of my sight ...{end}

Ugly, ugly, ugly!
Die so we don't
have to look at you.{end}

How dare you, you monster!
I'll remember this!{end}

I won't allow my beloved
wife and daughter to glimpse
a world tained by you!{end}

As long as you're around,
we will never know peace.{06}{07}
I'll cast you back to Hell
with my own hands!{end}

A peaceful world is a
stagnant cesspool.{06}{07}
Only change and death
can bring evolution.
An eternal progression ...{end}

It appears you and I
disagree on that count.{end}

Arrgghhh ...
I miscalculated ...{end}

Those Descendants of Light
are quite unnecessary.{06}{07}
We will crush you with
the might of the Empire!{end}

I've known of your resurrection
for a very long time ... and
as I've known, I've researched.{06}{07}
Fortunately, I discovered
some truly horrifying spells.{06}{07}
B{3a}ser, prepare for your
eternal banishment.{end}

Don't mock me.
Do you want to die?{06}{07}
You're so withered from
black magic, your standing
is an impressive feat.{end}

I won't die here.
This is my purpose ...{06}{07}
In order to end the darkness,
I've given up my parents,
my lover ... everything!{end}

My spell craft will
blast you to the abyss.{end}

So this is Castle Velzeria ...
The dark energy is growing ...{end}

I won't say I'm
fighting for humans!{06}{07}
I want my brother
and I to have a peaceful
world to live in!{end}

How dare you keep us
fooled for this long!{end}

I've suffered so much, ...
but I'll make you writhe in
more pain than I ever did!{end}

This is for my father!
You'll pay for deceiving
me all this time!{end}

Is your blood confused?
You can't defeat me.{06}{07}
But since you're so amusing,
I'll tell you something.{06}{07}
I was the one who spread
the plague to your village.{end}

Wh, what!?{end}

Yes. I also started the rumour
that you were strange,
that you wanted it to happen.{06}{07}
Stupid, naive humans ...
They really thought there
was an outbreak.{06}{07}
But no one was sick.
Mwa ha ha! The idiots!{end}

Because of you ...,
Because of you, I ...!{end}

No need for thanks.
I did it to initiate you, to
show you the darkness.{06}{07}
...{06}{07}
At any rate, the moronic
humans persecuted
you just as I planned.{end}

That, that can't be right!
All the suffering
I had to endure ...!{06}{07}
You ...
I'll make you writhe in worse
pain than I ever did!{end}

Without you, I would
have had a better life.{end}

Uugghh ..., B{3a}ser!{end}

Sonya, don't endanger yourself!
Rest and leave him to me!{end}

Ugh ... All right.
Take care, Brother.{end}

Sorry ..., Brother.
I couldn't defeat B{3a}ser.{end}

It's okay!
I'll take him
out for you!{06}{07}
Rohga and Sonya,
both of you
deserve some rest!{end}

Thank you, {02}.{end}

{font3}Fwa hah hah!
{font0}You pathetic worms!{end}

I've no more use
for you.
Time to die!{end}

Who could possibly
have killed you!?{end}

{font3}Humans, humans ...
Accept the inevitable
and allow us victory!{end}

{font3}Livestock have no
business with noblemen.
Why are you here?{end}

{font3}An immortal ...
should not die ...{end}

{font3}Your presence here
is impressive, but
it will soon be over.{end}

{font3}Blood ...
so much blood ...
everywhere ...{end}

{font3}Fighting me is a poor
gamble for your life.{end}

{font3}Aarrggghhh--!{end}

{font3}Uugghh ...{end}

{font3}Ooohhhh ...!{end}

{font3}Aaaahhh ...{end}

{font3}Ooohhh ...{end}

{font3}Arrghh ...{end}

{font3}Hee hee hee ...
Would you like to dream
for all eternity?{end}

{font3}I will be beautiful ...
Forever ...{end}

{font3}Hoh hoh hoh!{end}

{font3}I'll see you in Hell ...{end}

{font3}You will not
get near Lord B{3a}ser!{end}

{font3}I will kill the traitor!{end}

{font3}My body ... 
Can't move ...{end}

{font3}Humans have power?
Show me.{end}

{font3}Kill the traitor!{end}

{font3}I'm ... fading away ...{end}

One man and Langrisser ...
Can they really stop me?
Let us find out.{end}

Massacre them all!
Send everything to oblivion!{end}

This interference will
bring your annihilation.{end}

This battle's decided.
We won't lose
to the likes of you.{end}

Langrisser, Sword of Light ...
what a potent weapon.{end}

If you think this is just the
sword's doing, you're wrong.{06}{07}
Langrisser is nothing
without the faith of those
who desire peace.{end}

Yes, that is the true
strength of Langrisser.{06}{07}
Not only a fearsome weapon,
it is also a symbol to
rally behind, a mark of faith.{06}{07}
As more rally to its
banner, the sword's limitless
power is realised.{end}

How is your Dark Blade's
strength any different ...?{end}

Demons rally behind Alhazard
but do not lend it strength.{06}{07}
Alhazard instead feeds
on the ambitions and
desires of its human wielder.{06}{07}
But even though it draws
on the strength of a lone man--
make no mistake--its wielder
may achieve just as much!{end}

Toyed with by swords ...
What was this war for ...?{end}

Langrisser and Alhazard ...
Have we been your puppets?{end}

Your fight was not in vain.{06}{07}
My reign on this world
can only be broken
through direct action.{end}

Yes, we brought some degree
of peace to El Sallia.
You are beaten ... for now ...{end}

Heh heh heh ...
My body may dissolve
before your eyes ...{06}{07}
But I'll always be here ...
in all who desire and suffer,
in every glimmer of hate.{06}{07}
And when the tinders
of war return ...
I alone will spark them.{06}{07}
Chaos, ... you see,
... is eternal ...{end}

Lester and Jessica,
your vow is fulfilled ...
We have banished the darkness.{06}{07}
Now onward, everyone,
to a unified continent
and the ideal kingdom!{end}

We, at long last, have
banished the darkness.{06}{07}
Now onward, everyone,
to a unified continent
and the ideal kingdom!{end}

Wait a minute ...
We're restoring the seal we
worked so hard to break?{end}

We're going to reseal it
after everything we went
through to crack it open?{end}

Without the Descendant
lineage, Chaos will
rise again, won't he?{end}

Though their lineage has
ended, their will remains ...{06}{07}
As long as we
maintain peace, Chaos
won't come again.{end}

Though their lineage has
ended, their will remains ...{06}{07}
As long as we
maintain peace, Chaos
won't come again.{end}

So, is it all over?{end}

No ... The opposite, in fact.
Our real work begins now.{end}

Now then, let's return
to the Imperial Capital.{06}{07}
It's the beginning
of a bold new era!{end}

Uugghh ... Grrr--
Aaarrggghhh!{06}{07}
Humans, damned
worthless humans!
How could I lose to you--!?{end}

Don't underestimate us!{end}

It's true that humans
can be foolish and weak!{06}{07}
But humans have
hope, too!{06}{07}
We believe in ourselves
and value our friends.{06}{07}
Together, we can
stand up to any hardship.{end}

But being the friendless
and sadistic fiend you are,
you wouldn't understand.{end}

What drivel.
Unbelievable ...{06}{07}
This isn't over yet!
Alhazard, my Dark Blade,
unleash your power now!{end}

Wh, what ...?
I, I can't move ...{06}{07}
It's draining me ...
My magic ... is being
drained by the sword ...{06}{07}
Why, Alhazard!?{06}{07}
Alha ... za--{end}

I am the God of Chaos.
I awake by thy wish.{end}

Ch, Chaos ...!?{end}

Chaos? Wh ...{end}

My name is Chaos.{06}{07}
Starting now, I will
accomplish the goal
I was created for.{end}

Is that the physical
representation of evil!?{end}

I was born with
the dawn of time.{06}{07}
My purpose is to see
that this world remains in
the flames of chaos for
the whole of eternity.{06}{07}
For the sake of evolution,
I maintain a state of entropy.
I will break all.{end}

We won't allow that!{end}

You think you can stop us
from bringing this land
a well-deserved peace?{end}

Peace violates the
rules of the universe.{06}{07}
All who would stand
against turmoil and destruction
will be eradicated.{end}

I won't let you do that!
I will seal you
with Langrisser!{end}

Then come challenge me.
Witness the limitation of
useless, fleeting life ...{end}

Hmph ...
Only fools fall
to such tricks.{end}

Alhazard and Langrisser
have lived out their destinies.{06}{07}
Now the two maidens must
seal them away for all time.{end}

That's right.
Our power is sufficient now
and we require neither.{06}{07}
To check Alhazard's
presence, we took possession
of the Sword of Light.{06}{07}
But with that threat
removed, both legendary swords
are better off asleep.{06}{07}
Our Empire will not repeat
the mistakes of the past ...
We will build a future of peace!{end}

Sonya, just because you
were half demon ...
Just because of that ...{06}{07}
Everyone hated you,
everyone drove you off.
Damn them all ...!{end}

I'll tell you something else.{06}{07}
I knew humans would hate
Sonya for her heritage.
In fact, I counted on it.{06}{07}
Humans are so totally moronic,
they believed a half-demon
was the cause of the plague ...{end}

You worthless bastard ...
You set her up right
from the start, didn't you?{end}

Yes, yes!
Anger! Hate!{06}{07}
Release your emotions and
fall to your inner darkness!{end}

Impressive ...
Langrisser's power ...{06}{07}
No matter. With Alhazard,
my minions will feast on your
your bloodied remains.{end}

B{3a}ser, your life ends here!{end}

Witness the
true worth of Alhazard!{end}
