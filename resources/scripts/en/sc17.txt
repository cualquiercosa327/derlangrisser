Let's hope Imelda and the
Water Dragon Navy can hold
back the enemy ...{end}

Yeah! No matter how strong
they are, they can't beat
General Imelda.{06}{07}
We've got no reason to
stick around here and
build a useless fort.{end}

They are coming.
I'm certain of it.{06}{07}
No matter how strong
General Imelda may be, she'll
underestimate their strength.{06}{07}
If she doesn't take them
seriously, she won't win.{06}{07}
At any rate, General Vargas
has already seen just how
strong their leader is.{end}

They're coming!
The rebel forces
are approaching!{end}

Right!{end}

Sigh ...
Liana, are we there yet?
I'm so exhausted.{end}

Castle Baldea should be
just over this mountain.{end}

Hein, stop being so lazy.{end}

Hey, wait!
There's an enemy fortress!{end}

Gwa ha ha ...
You made it here at last!{06}{07}
But this is as far as you go.
This place shall be your grave!{end}

Who is that guy ...?
Have we seen him before?{end}

Yeah, it's Colonel Zorum again.{06}{07}
He's General Vargas'
right hand man ...
Well, so he says.{end}

You punk!
Are you trying to insult me!?{06}{07}
This time I'll shut that noisy
mouth of yours for good!
I'm not holding back any more!{end}

Uh oh, he's not
going to go easy on me.{end}

General Vargas isn't here,
but no matter.
We must stop them.{06}{07}
Even with our bare hands,
we shall hold them off!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

How on earth did they find
time to build such a fortress?{06}{07}
I'm sure there was never
anything this size here before.{end}

It looks like they did all this
just to stop us, Princess.{end}

They're really determined,
I'll give them that.{end}

This will be a tough fight.{end}

Then we'll just have to
surpass their determination.
Everyone, let's go!{end}

Until we know for sure that
the general's baby is born,
we cannot die.{end}

Ha ha ha!
That's the spirit, men!{06}{07}
Let these kids see the power
of the Blazing Dragon Army.{end}

Yeah!
We can't die until we know the
General's baby has been born. {end}

All right, let's show
that little punk the full
extent of our power! {end}

The enemy is using ballista.{end}

Leave the explanation to me!
After Scott left I started
to study battle tactics.{06}{07}
Ballista use a system of pulleys
to hurl rocks and spears,
so they have an incredibly
long attack range.{06}{07}
Flying troops need to be
careful since a single hit
from a ballista unit may be
enough to take them down.{end}

What in the hell are
you talking about!?{06}{07}
Flying troops are so fast and
agile that ballista won't even
have a chance to aim.{06}{07}
Therefore, flying troops
have nothing to worry about.{06}{07}
You stupid wizard!
If you don't know what you're
talking about, then just keep
your mouth shut!{end}

Hmph ...,
how rude!{end}

That's correct.
Among projectile units,
ballista are special.{06}{07}
But Princess, ...
when did you study this?{end}

Hee hee hee ...
That's a {font4}Secret.{end}

However, Princess, your
commentary shows your tactical
knowledge has a ways to go.{06}{07}
Since aerial units are
weak to ballista attacks,
if they rush in unprepared, they
can be easily wiped out.{end}

I was right--you were wrong!
Told you, told you, told you!{06}{07}
They really do need
to be careful!{end}

Hein, I hate you!{end}

Well, Princess, from
now on you should study
more carefully.{end}

You see strange piece of
cloth lying on the ground.{06}{07}

Will you pick it up?{end}

Obtained Wizard's Robe.{end}

As I would expect from
an Imperial fortress ...{06}{07}
We should have planned
more carefully ...{end}

Ouch--!
This isn't good.{end}

Oww!
Damn, I'll be back later!{end}

Aah, ... {02}.
I'm sorry ...{end}

Princess ...
Sorry ...{end}

Shit!
I'm done for!{end}

Ahh ...
I've lost ...{end}

Colonel Zorum!
Let's settle this right now!{06}{07}
Concentrate all attacks on
the redheaded punk!
He's the rebel scum's leader!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Redheaded boy!
I'll avenge Zorum!{end}

Redheaded boy!
I'll avenge Zorum!{06}{07}
All troops, concentrate
your attacks on
the red-haired one!{end}

Is this the end ...?
Sigh ..., such is the
fate of any true soldier.{end}

General Vargas!{end}

Wait!
We've come to save you!{end}

Leon, ... it's too late for that.
As a fellow warrior,
I have one final request.{06}{07}
My child is soon to be born.
Please tell my wife,
Eliza, that ...
that I'm not coming home.{06}{07}
Tell her her husband fought
bravely to the end with his
men so his child could grow
up in a world without war ...{end}

Yes, friend ...
I swear I'll tell her.{end}

I'm sorry to give
you such a terrible task ...{end}

General Leon ...{end}

Laird, you will lead our
troops to Castle Baldea!{06}{07}
I must give Vargas'
message to Eliza ...
I will leave immediately.{end}

Yes, understood!{end}

{02}!{06}{07}
I swear on the name of
the Blue Dragon Knights,
I will kill you!{06}{07}
Remember this.
Farewell, for now.{end}

So this is the real
face of war ...{end}

It's so sad ...{end}

I hate fighting.
Why is it that everyone
must kill?{06}{07}
Why hasn't war disappeared?
Aren't there more important
things in our lives?{end}

Let's go, {02}!
To end such wars ...
Once and for all.{end}

Yes, ...
we must put an
end to all this ...{end}

Let's go everyone,
for the future of El Sallia.{end}

Zorum ...!{06}{07}
No matter how strong
I am, it's obvious we're
at a disadvantage.{06}{07}
Knowing this, how could I
leave you alone to fight
as I retreat to safety?{06}{07}
Do you really think
I could do such a thing?{end}

If that's true, ... then I'll
fight beside my general
to the bitter end!{end}

Shit, how pathetic ...{06}{07}
General Vargas, avenge me--!{end}

Zorum!{end}

You fool!
You're not allowed
to die on me!{end}

Ahhh!
If only I could have been
a little more useful ...{end}

G, General Vargas ...{end}

R, regretfully ...{end}

No matter how strong
I am, it's obvious we're
at a disadvantage.{06}{07}
Knowing this, how could I
leave you alone to fight
as I retreat to safety?{06}{07}
Do you really think
I could do such a thing?{end}

If that's true, ... then we'll
fight beside our general
to the bitter end!{end}

Ugh ...
So it has come to this ...{06}{07}
With my last ounce of
strength I shall ave ... nge ...{end}

Right flank, attack!{end}

Right flank, attack!{end}

Right flank, attacking!{end}

I, I can still ...
fight ...{end}

Attack!{end}

Son of a bitch ...
You kids won't be so
lucky next time!{end}

Left flank attack!{end}

Left flank attack!{end}

Let's go!
Take them down!{end}

L, long live the Empire!{end}

Sh, shit!
They're strong ...{end}

They really did come!{06}{07}
Listen up! We can't let
them go any further!
No matter what, we'll defend
this fortress to the end!{end}

Right now, General Vargas
is with Lady Eliza!{06}{07}
With our strength, we shall
defeat the enemy.
The songs of our victory will
be a lullaby for his new baby!{end}

General Vargas!
Please leave this to us and
return to Lady Eliza.{06}{07}
Even if it costs us our lives,
we won't let them pass!{end}

We don't have anyone
waiting for our return!{06}{07}
But our General has
an expecting wife
waiting back home ...{end}

General Vargas!
Why are you here?
Is Lady Eliza okay with this?{end}

Argh!{end}

Are you all right, Zorum?{end}

Tell me, for this important
battle, what would you do
without my command?{end}

But General Vargas ...{end}

Silence!
Now just think
about winning!{end}

You little runt!
Look what you've
done to my men!{end}

Is everyone okay?{end}

Tell me, what would
you do without my
command in this battle?{end}

But General Vargas ...{end}

But General Vargas ...{end}

Thanks for the concern.
For now, just concentrate
on beating the enemy!{end}

My father was a man
who would abandon
his comrades to run home.{06}{07}
Can you call that pride?{06}{07}
When someone leaves his men
to die and saves himself?
No, he was a complete coward.{06}{07}
To think, when I was young, he
looked down on me all the time.
I won't have my child
suffer such feelings ...{06}{07}
A child shouldn't be
ashamed of his father.{06}{07}
No matter the odds,
I'll fight without running.{06}{07}
I want to be a brave man, ...
a man worthy of praise ...
That's all I've ever wanted.{end}

I won't die!
I'll win and return to
my wife and child!{end}
