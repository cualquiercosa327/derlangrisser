Your Majesty, though I
profoundly regret to say it, the
invaders have penetrated.{end}

Really? Yes, I see now ...
Allying with B{3a}ser was a
dangerous game, one we lost.{06}{07}
Egbert, your wounds look deep.
Will you be all right?{end}

I'm by no means in top form,
but this is nothing
to worry yourself with.{end}

Do not forget, we possess
the Demons' Might, Alhazard.{06}{07}
Even while sealed,
it's not to be taken lightly.{end}

We have readied ourselves
and will soon intercept those
who have troubled His Majesty.{end}

We have plenty of men and
supplies, Your Majesty. Allow
us to cover your withdrawal.{end}

Don't speak foolishness!{06}{07}
I will not hide in some rat hole.
I am the Kaiser of Rayguard!{end}

This is the end for you,
Kaiser Bernhardt.{end}

Ahh, ... it's you.
The scoundrel {02}.{06}{07}
One side and then the other,
whenever it's convenient, hmm?
What a fickle young man.{06}{07}
Please rest assured,
you won't be the first
traitor to die here.{end}

By some miracle, you
breached the castle gate with
your modest little force.{06}{07}
But your luck has run
out, and your lives are now
under my jurisdiction.{06}{07}
{02}, you have taken
my dream and perverted it
with your naive mind.{06}{07}
Drop Langrisser and take
your leave. If you do this now,
I may even spare you.{end}

Do you take me for a fool,
you senile old man?{end}

Langrisser is not fit
for this pathetic
excuse of an Empire!{end}

Hmmm ...
What brings you
here, B{3a}ser?{end}

The same reason as you--
there's something I desire.{06}{07}
Give me Alhazard and its key.
By which I mean,
of course, the Dark Rod.{end}

Heh heh heh.
You're in for quite a shock,
fiend. You'll take neither!{end}

Do you want them badly
enough to face a Kaiser and
his chief magician?{end}

{02}, I have a
proposition. Let us take
Alhazard and the Dark Rod.{06}{07}
If we succeed, this world
will be ours alone. You will
be second only to me.{end}

Yes ...{06}{07}
Langrisser and Alhazard ...
With both in hand,
we would fear nothing!{end}

As the Kaiser's elite guard,
they cannot be overestimated.
Remember that.{end}

So ... this is the kind of
person who prevents
Alhazard's resurrection, eh?{end}

Langrisser's power is not
unlike that of a man.{06}{07}
If you weary it too
much, it may break.{end}

Above the pedestal there
is a blue coloured potion.{06}{07}

Will you drink it?{end}

MDF raised!{end}

Above the pedestal there
is a red coloured potion.{06}{07}

Will you drink it?{end}

Movement raised!{end}

You heard something shatter
on the opposite pedestal ...{end}

Hand over Alhazard.{end}

Heh heh heh.
Give me Langrisser first, and
I just may consider it.{end}

If you don't want to die,
give up the Dark Rod!{end}

You think you can beat me.
That's your first, and
most deadly, mistake.{end}

I can't ... die just ... yet ...
Aarrrghhh--!{end}

They really were strong ...{end}

I'm not as battle-ready
as I thought ...{06}{07}
I need to rest ...
just a bit ...{end}

Damn ...
Right before Lord B{3a}ser.
Pitiful ...{end}

Sorry ...
I'm exhausted ...{end}

{font3}Ridiculous ...
My power is gone ...{end}

{font3}Worthless humans!
I will feast on you!{end}

Your men are unshaken,
even after meeting demons
at their own gates.{06}{07}
Do they know they're
all going to die here?{end}

It seems ... I misjudged you ...
Are you really ...
that powerful ...?{end}

Obtained Alhazard.{end}

Yes, at last ...
We have Alhazard!{end}

Take joy while
you can.{06}{07}
My plans will manifest,
and those swords
shall yet be mine.{06}{07}
Today was unfortunate, ...
but I look forward to our
next encounter, {02}.{end}

Let's give {39}em
a bloodbath!{end}

I'm counting on you!
Let's send them
straight to Hell!{end}

To defend His Majesty,
I've sworn even my life!{end}

Long live the Kaiser!{end}

I regret nothing ...!{end}

Y, Your Majesty ...{end}

If you're going to fight,
then get on with it!{end}

I can't be defeated here ...
Not yet ... Not now ...{end}

You won't ascend
one more stair!{end}

Your Majesty ...
Forgive ... this ...{end}

I will never accept
defeat from demons!{06}{07}
I'll perish before you
meet His Majesty's eyes!{end}

Your lives
shall end here!{end}

Im, impossible ...
No ... Nooo ...!{end}

This power
that you have ...{end}

Decent ... but you're ...
not Imperial material ...
by any stretch ...{end}

The last of my life ...
To protect the Kaiser--!{end}

Ugh ...
H, how can they have
such power ...?{end}

G, gahh!{end}

I don't need
Alhazard's twisted power!{06}{07}
I will unify this world with
Langrisser alone!{end}

That seems
to make sense ...{end}

However ...
If you intend to break the seal,
please do it quickly.{end}

Liana is the
maiden of light?{end}

Yes, I see.
We will find Liana.{end}

All right, we're done here.
Our next objective
is Salrath's conquest!{end}

Run, Imperials,
like the cowards you are!{06}{07}
Now, reviving Alhazard
should be our top priority.{end}

Alhazard commands the
Demon Tribe. Don't forget
that, {02}.{06}{07}
To control this world,
we'll need power over both
monsters and humans.{end}

That's right ... If you want
true unification, you'll need
to earn the demons' respect.{end}

Let's not get ahead
of ourselves. There are
preparations to make.{06}{07}
We need the young girl
Liana, the maiden of light.{end}

The maiden of light is
being sheltered
in Castle Kalxath.{06}{07}
You must cut through
Salrath to get there, but they
shouldn't pose much threat.{06}{07}
Sonya will hear my
next plan after you've
managed this one.{end}

Heh heh heh ...
Well done, {02}.{06}{07}
Alhazard now lies
in its rightful hand.{end}

Such vile beings!
You offend this castle
with your presence!{end}
