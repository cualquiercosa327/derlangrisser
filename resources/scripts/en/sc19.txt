You must be tired!
How did the battle go?{end}

W, well ...{end}

There's no reason to hide it.{06}{07}
We failed the mission,
and the Descendants of Light
claimed Langrisser.{06}{07}
They are approaching!
Gather our remaining
men and attack!
We must protect His Majesty!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

At last, ...
we made it.{end}

Wow ...{06}{07}
Words alone can't describe
the splendour of this castle.
The Kaiser must be inside.{end}

Let's hurry!
We'll have an easy
victory with Langrisser!{06}{07}
It's time to witness
how powerful this
sword truly is.{end}

I can't allow this.{06}{07}
In the name of the
Blue Dragon Knights,
you shall not advance.{end}

I'm sorry, General Leon.{06}{07}
If we had more time,
we would've been able to
make better preparations.{end}

Don't worry.
We only need delay
them for a little while.{06}{07}
If we succeed, then
we can prepare an ambush
within the castle.{end}

Understood.
Let's show them it takes more
than numbers to defeat us.{end}

Somehow, we made it in time.{end}

{02}, please,
give me orders!
Allow me to demonstrate{06}{07}
the results of my training!{end}

Got it.
Listen up, men.{end}

We are facing greater numbers,
but we can't give up the fight!{end}

I'll assist you, Leon.{end}

Dark Princess!?{06}{07}
The Blue Dragon Knights
received the defence orders.
Our strength is sufficient.{06}{07}
I have no need of
a woman's help.{end}

I owe you so much ...
Please, let me assist
you, Leon!{06}{07}
Besides, don't think of me as
an ordinary woman ...
You know me better than that.{end}

All right ...
Try not to get hurt!{end}

Leon!?{end}

Anyone who defeated Leon
must be strong indeed.{06}{07}
Since I still owe him, you
can entertain me for a while.{end}

...!?{end}

They look exactly the same.
How is this possible?{end}

They really do!
They look like twins.{end}

It's uncanny ...
But I have better taste in
clothes than she does.{end}

Something shimmers in a hole.
Will you examine it?{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

They made it this far ...{end}

Curses ...
I am beaten.{end}

Sorry, I can't fight.
Let me take a break.{end}

Princess, this is it for me.
I'll try again later ...{end}

Sorry everyone ...
I must fall back!{end}

I'm too old for this.
Let me catch ...
my breath ...{end}

My training wasn't enough ...{end}

I'm sorry ...
I've gotten in the way again.{end}

Laird, let's go!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

{02}, let's go!{end}

If this fight drags on,
we'll be at a disadvantage.{06}{07}
Our enemy is experienced,
so give it your best!{end}

Understood!{end}

Damn, quite impressive!{06}{07}
However, we haven't
forgotten that your strength
comes from Langrisser.{06}{07}
Alhazard's revival is at hand.
When that happens, you
won't have a chance!{end}

Because of that sword ...
That must be why
they beat Leon ...{06}{07}
Bernhardt won't be pleased ...
I cannot let you hurt
Leon any more!{06}{07}
Behold ... the true power
of the Demon Tribe!{end}

Stop, L{37}na.
We are at a disadvantage
here, retreat!{end}

Leon, ...
I don't feel good about
leaving you alone like this.{end}

Just do it, for my sake!
I won't have you
endanger yourself.{end}

Don't you mean for
Bernhardt's sake ...?{end}

Is that what you think?{end}

This time, I'll overlook it.
Next time, I won't forgive you!{end}

Everyone, retreat!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Until we meet
again, {02}.{end}

L{37}na ...
Why--?{end}

But, she ...
Who is this "Dark Princess?"{end}

Something has happened to her.
This isn't her true self ...{end}

It seems somebody
is controlling her.{end}

Lady Jessica!
Are you all right?
Are you injured?{end}

No, I'm all right, Lester.{end}

Jessica!
Are you injured?{06}{07}
More importantly,
what does all this mean?{end}

Her mind is being controlled.
I felt a powerful spell
at work upon her.{06}{07}
Somebody suppressed
her will and is manipulating
her like a puppet.{end}

Really ...
But who has such power?{end}

We don't have time
to ponder this.
Reinforcements are arriving!{end}

What the--!?{end}

I will take care of this.
Hurry into the castle!{end}

I understand.
Then I'll leave the rest to you.{end}

{02}!
At last, the decisive battle!{end}

Yeah,
I'll do my best!{end}

Everyone!
Break down the doors, for
the final battle is at hand!{06}{07}
Once inside, we shall find
Kaiser Bernhardt and end
his dreams of a tyrannical 
reign over El Sallia!{06}{07}
True peace cannot be
attained under martial law.{end}

Damn it, 
in this of all fights ...{end}

Laird!
Worry about it later.
Retreat for now.{end}

I'm sorry ...{end}

This is it ...
Fall back ...{end}

Gahh--!{end}

Strong ...
Too strong--!{end}

Glory to the Empire!{end}

This is no good.
I can't get back up ...{end}

{font3}Groan ...{end}

{font3}Grrrr!{end}

Those who carry
the Wings of Flame,
heed my call!{06}{07}
Rise from your immortal plane!{end}

I'll show you my power!
I'll show you the
cold grip of darkness!{end}

Don't let your guard
down, Dark Princess.{end}

Tee hee ...
If we are together, then I
have nothing to fear.{end}

Damn ...
Too powerful--{end}

Dark Princess!
That's enough--please retreat.{end}

I can still fight ...{end}

The defence of the
castle is our mission.
You certainly have{06}{07}
better things to do.{06}{07}
Please retreat.
We can't afford to lose you!{end}

Once again, I owe you one ...
Until I can return
the favour, I'll retreat ...{end}

I understand.{06}{07}
Until we realise our dream--
a war-less, peaceful world ...
Until I see that day,
I won't be defeated.{end}

Hearing that makes
me feel better, Leon.
Please be careful!{06}{07}
They are the
Descendants of Light.{end}

My Blue Dragon Knights
have fallen ...{06}{07}
But I cannot yield!
Even if I must battle alone,
I will protect this castle
until the bitter end!{end}

Leon, it's over!
Any more fighting is a waste.{end}

Don't make me laugh!
The Knights are not known
for cowardice!{06}{07}
The only way into this
castle is through me!{end}

Leon ...{end}

Sister?
I'm your sister?
I have, I have a sister ...{06}{07}
Argh--!
My ... my head!{end}

Shut up!
I have no past!{06}{07}
The past is unnecessary ...
It will be swept away
by a future of darkness!{end}

{02}!{06}{07}
I've waited long for
the chance to fight you!
I'll repay you for Vargas!{end}

Isn't that Scott?
Why is he here?{end}

Is that Scott!?{end}

I heard from Jessica
about the situation.
I'm here to help.{end}

Scott joins the entourage!{end}

I've been training hard
since we last met!{end}

Wait, please!
Aren't you my sister, L{37}na!?{end}

L{37}na!
Are you okay?{end}

L{37}na!{end}

What!?{06}{07}
The Dark Princess
is Liana's sister?{end}

Sister?
The Dark Princess
is her sister?{end}

Yes, there's no mistake.{06}{07}
My sister and I are twins.
We were abandoned at
the entrance of a shrine.{06}{07}
The priest took us in, but
while we were children,
somebody kidnapped her.{06}{07}
I can't believe I would
finally meet her here ...{end}

Wow.
When I got to know Liana,
she never mentioned a sister ...{end}

Well, ...
I did feel a strange
aura surrounding her ...{end}
