This cave is strange ...
Did people live here?{end}

Hello, everybody!
Welcome to the second
secret stage!{end}

It is time for the
Masayan Quiz.{06}{07}
I'll be your
quiz master, Kanio.{06}{07}
How are you enjoying
Der Langrisser?{06}{07}
After you are done playing,
please fill out the
questionnaire postcard.{06}{07}
Please include your
impressions of this stage!{end}

What in the world is
he babbling about?{06}{07}
Weird guy ...{end}

We couldn't spend much
time on this secret stage
for some reason.{06}{07}
There might be a few bugs
because we built it too fast.{end}

Well, anyway, let me
explain the rules.{06}{07}
Challenge the units
around this battlefield.{06}{07}
Before you enter battle,
each commander will quiz you.{06}{07}
If you get the question
correct, the battle will
proceed as normal.{06}{07}
Make a mistake, and the
units will retreat.{06}{07}
The winning condition
is to defeat Uki.{06}{07}
If you answer every
quiz right we will give
you a small gift.{06}{07}
Well everyone,
do your best!{end}

What?{06}{07}
I guess we should just
attack everyone ...{end}

Why do we have to fight?
I think this will be
a waste of our time ...{end}

I don't know. I think it's
a good opportunity to have
fun and relax a little.{end}

As long as we're here,
it can't be helped.{06}{07}
Let's go, everyone!{end}

I am defeated!{end}

Hey hey!

Wrong!{06}{07}
