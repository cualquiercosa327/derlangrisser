The Dark Rod is still here.
Perhaps there's time ...{end}

{font3}You who trespass
upon these forbidden
grounds, leave now!{06}{07}
{font3}This is a sacred place
which no one may enter.{06}{07}
{font3}Should you intrude,
know well that your
lives will end here.{end}

What are these creatures ...?{end}

They appear to be ancient
Guardians, ... beings that exist
only to protect the Dark Rod.{end}

Then they would prevent
Egbert from taking the
Dark Rod as well?{end}

No ...
The Guardians are not
powerful enough to stop him.{end}

If that's the case, then we
must defeat them and claim
the Dark Rod first!{end}

Hein, that's far too reckless.{06}{07}
Maybe if our opponents were
another group of soldiers ...,
instead of these undead terrors.{end}

I still cannot believe
that, once upon a time, Egbert
was Jessica's apprentice.{end}

Before my rebirth, he
had been studying magic
under my direction.{06}{07}
Gradually, Egbert became
obsessed with finding ever
more powerful magic ...{06}{07}
After he ceased to be my
student, he joined
Kaiser Bernhardt to build
the Rayguard Empire.{end}

With the Kaiser's and my
combined strength, uniting
the continent is a simple task.{06}{07}
If we can unleash Alhazard,
we will wield such a power
that the rule of our Empire
shall never be challenged.{06}{07}
Our dream of continental
conquest will become a reality.{end}

Egbert, ...
your words make me regret
ever making you my student.{06}{07}
At least I can still redeem
my error by halting your
evil ambitions here!{end}

Another time, perhaps, master.
I must return to Rayguard
so we may revive Alhazard.{06}{07}
Arguing with you is something
I currently have no time for.{end}

Ah, the young ones!
So this is where you fled.{end}

General Vargas!?{end}

You there, boy!
I've been looking for you ...
I shall avenge Zorum's death!{end}

Just great!{06}{07}
First, we are forced to battle
a shrine full of undead
Guardians while Egbert steals
away with the Dark Rod ...{06}{07}
Now Vargas is here
with an axe to grind
over a subordinate who
was too foolish to retreat ...{end}

First, we get stuck in a shrine
full of undead Guardians while
Egbert steals the Dark Rod ...{06}{07}
Now Vargas is here
with an axe to grind
over a subordinate who
was too foolish to retreat ...{end}

Stop complaining
and start fighting!{end}

Heh, ...
as I expected, the Guardians
were no match for you.{end}

Egbert!{end}

It seems you've beaten
some of the Guardians.{06}{07}
I guess I should be
polite and say thanks.{end}

Any power can be
controlled when in the
hands of a competent user.{06}{07}
Isn't that what you
used to say, Jessica?
Or would you rather I still
call you my master?{end}

That's right.{06}{07}
However, that son of a
bitch vanished right
after Jessica's rebirth.{end}

Ha ha ha ...{06}{07}
Oh Lester ...
Sadly, I have more aims
in life than to play babysitter
for a seven-hundred-year-old.{end}

Hmph, ...
same sarcastic fuck as ever ...{end}

"The Muscular Shrine ...?"
What could this mean?
I guess we'll find out later.{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

Excellent work, but I still
cannot give you the Dark Rod.{end}

Gah--!
Is this the end ...?{end}

Gah--!
Th, their ancient magic
is incredibly powerful!{end}

No ...
I cannot lose here--!{end}

Curses ...
That was a mistake.
Sorry, but I must retreat ...{end}

Gahh--!
Sorry, I overestimated myself{end}

I'm here to protect Jessica!
You bastards won't
lay a hand on her!{end}

Hmmm ...,
Lester, do you really
have so much power?{end}

You sure have a big mouth.
Let's find out if my fist fits!{end}

Damn!
Not bad ...{end}

Jessica, stay where you are!
It's too dangerous to enter.{end}

It's true that I haven't fully
recovered my power yet ...{06}{07}
However, I still have more than
enough strength to help you!
Just watch!{end}

Egbert!
Prepare yourself!{end}

Hmmm ...
Jessica, give up!{end}

Eeek ...
If only I had a little
more time ... just a little--!{end}

I can fight, too!{end}

It shouldn't have
been like this ...{end}

Liana, are you okay?
Please leave this to us.
Just hide somewhere safe.{end}

I'm so sorry ...
I had said I wouldn't be
a burden, but ...{end}

Hah hah hah ...
Attacking me is but a
waste of your power.{end}

Hmmm ...
Could such a plain trinket
truly be the Dark Rod?{end}

Egbert!
Stop!{end}

Shut up!
Wait, ... who are you!?{06}{07}
Ahh, ... I see.
The winged circlet of Baldea.
A Descendant of Light ...{end}

A descendant of what?
What are you talking about!?{end}

Before I left Rayguard, 
I was warned that the
Descendants of Light
would hinder me ...{06}{07}
I guess they were wrong,
for the Dark Rod is already
mine! Ha ha ha!{end}

Egbert! Stop!{end}

What on earth is this ...{end}

{font3}Groan ...
So many fools have
come today.{06}{07}
{font3}None who set foot
within this sacred shrine
shall be forgiven!{06}{07}
{font3}You will all die here.{end}

{font3}Die, fools who
dared enter this
forbidden palace!{end}

{font3}A reckless human ...
to pick a fight with
one such as I.{06}{07}
{font3}I will show you the
experience of eternity.{end}

{font3}Impossible--!
I cannot be ... defeated--{end}

{font3}Whelp!{end}

{font3}Awooo ...{end}

{font3}Splurt!{end}

{font3}Glurg!{end}

{font3}Rest ...
At last ....{end}

{font3}Finally, some rest ...{end}

{font3}No!
Anything but that!{06}{07}
{font3}Zapp!{end}

{font3}Thank ... you ...{end}

Zorum ... wait for me!{06}{07}
Before this day is done, these
children's heads will rest on
your grave as an offering!{end}

That's for Colonel Zorum!
I'll send you to hell!{end}

Ugghhh ...
I can't die yet!{06}{07}
One day ... I will surely
avenge Zorum!
Enjoy what little remains
of your lives!{end}

Hmm!
You're doing quite well!{end}

{font3}The thieves are
stronger than I
had expected ...{end}

What!?
Egbert was once one
of Jessica's students?{end}

Egbert ...,
you must understand how
dangerous Alhazard is ...{end}

I detest being called master
by one who has become so
corrupted by lust for power!{end}

...{06}{07}
This is the end ...
Langrisser is our only hope.{end}

Regardless, the Dark Rod
is in the hands of the Kaiser.{06}{07}
All that he needs now
is a catalyst to release
the sword's true power.{end}

Even so, the Guardians
have awoken and will not
return to their rest.{06}{07}
If we leave without defeating
the Guardians, they will
massacre the villagers at the
foot of the mountain.{end}

With the Dark Rod in their
hands, it's only a matter of time
before Alhazard is unsealed.{06}{07}
In all this world, only one
thing can stand against the
fully-powered Alhazard:
Langrisser, the Sword of Light.{end}

Langrisser is sealed within
the halls of Castle Baldea ...{06}{07}
However, ... the castle vanished
long ago from the eyes of man.{end}

Castle Baldea ... I've read
of it in old manuscripts in
Estool's Shrine of Light.{06}{07}
I may have an idea
where it rests today ...{end}

Then I entrust Liana to be
your guide to Castle Baldea.{06}{07}
In the meantime, I'll try to
persuade other countries
to join in opposing the Empire.{end}

The banner of Kalxath
should be a good rallying point
for anti-imperial nations.{end}

No ...
You must go to Baldea as well
to fight the Empire.{06}{07}
If the Empire is planning to use
Alhazard, then they cannot
ignore the threat Langrisser
poses to their goals.{06}{07}
Before leaving for Baldea, we
should mass our forces.
Lester, I want you to go
with them to Baldea.{end}

Lady Jessica, you
know I can't ...{end}

Lester, worry not about me.
I can defend myself.{06}{07}
Right now, all the people
of El Sallia are at risk.
Defend them instead.{end}

I understand ...
Then I'll go with
{02} to Baldea.{end}

Liana,
I can feel a great power
emanating from you.{06}{07}
I am still uncertain what it is,
but you must be more confident.
You are stronger than
you yet realise.{end}

Hurry then ...
to Baldea! Go before the Empire
can obtain Langrisser!{end}

Farewell, everyone.
Take good care
of yourselves ...{end}

The Dark Rod was stolen.{end}

Oh, no!
Stop him before he takes
the Dark Rod!{end}

You are too late!{end}

It's hopeless ...
We can't stop him!{end}

Now that I have the Dark Rod,
I can report to his majesty.{06}{07}
Descendants of Light,
we shall meet again.
That is, if you live that long ...{end}

Wait!{end}

Heh heh heh ...{06}{07}
I'll defeat Jessica one
day, but not now.
A victory over her in such a
feeble state is no victory at all.{06}{07}
Farewell.{end}

Damn!{end}

Shit, ... he escaped.
There's no longer any point in
fighting these Guardians, right?{end}

By Lushiris! I understand ...
Egbert was even more
clever than I had imagined ...{06}{07}
Everyone, let's finish
them quickly.{end}

It seems we have
vanquished them all ...{end}

The Kaiser needs a catalyst ...
What could it be?{end}

I don't know either ...{end}

A catalyst to unleash
something so powerful can't
be a simple object.{end}

Hmmm ...
You're right. This catalyst may
not even be a "thing".{end}

This truly has turned
into a nightmare.{06}{07}
The Dark Rod has been taken,
and we don't know anything
about the catalyst, either ...{06}{07}
We should at least find out
more about it ...{end}

Langrisser!?
The Legendary Sword!{06}{07}
I can't believe it really exists.{end}

Langrisser?
You mean the
Legendary Sword?{end}

So, where would we
find Langrisser?{end}

Y, yes!{end}

I understand.
Let us be off.{end}

We have to go to Baldea,
but what should we do
about the sanctuary?{06}{07}
It may still house another
secret behind that door near
the strange sign.{end}

Do you want to investigate it?{end}

Well, we may as well
see what's through the passage.{06}{07}
Hmmm ...!
It's the doorway to
a second shrine!{06}{07}
Maybe we can find out
something more about
Alhazard in there.{end}

Let's go!
It's time to head for Baldea.{end}
