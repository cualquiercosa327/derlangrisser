Stubborn, aren't you?
Give up before I send
you to your grave!{end}

Why don't you end this siege?
Taking such a small fort
won't bring you any fame.{end}

I don't care about fame!
Those who ignore
my orders shall die!{06}{07}
If only you had listened the
first time, I might have spared
your miserable little lives!{end}

I'll never take orders from you!
Why don't you act
more like a lady?{end}

Silence, you fool!{end}

G, General Imelda!{end}

Kr{38}mer!
You failed the
mission, didn't you!?{end}

I, I'm sorry,
General Imelda, but ...{end}

Kr{38}mer!
How dare you show your face
after failing a mission!{end}

General Imelda!
Please give me another chance!{end}

The Water Dragon Navy
does not forgive failure!{end}

I, Ime ...
Gahh ...{end}

Hmph!
Useless trash!{end}

Hurry up and begin the attack!{06}{07}
It will be quite annoying
if their reinforcements
come from Kalxath.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

General Imelda!
It's their reinforcements!{end}

Shit!
That idiot, Kr{38}mer!{end}

The Imperial Army!?{end}

You're going to regret it
if you don't move your
troops away from that fort!{end}

Quite a spirited young girl.{end}

Princess, she is the
Water Dragon Navy's
General, Imelda.{end}

Heh heh ...
Am I so well-known?{end}

They still haven't
taken the fortress!
Let's hurry!{end}

Don't even dare
get in my way!{end}

Go! Attack!
Take the stronghold,
and don't screw up!{06}{07}
Now is our chance,
the enemy can't
attack us amongst
innocent villagers.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

You ...
you cowards!{end}

Wa ha ha!
I'll do whatever it
takes to win.{06}{07}
And as a bonus, I'll
send you all to hell
together, so you
won't be lonely.{06}{07}
Quite generous, aren't I?{end}

Imelda, you cowardly bitch!
Even at my age, I won't lose to
such gutless Imperials!{end}

How heartless.{06}{07}
I was foolish to believe
someone like her.
Everyone, return to the
stronghold--immediately!{end}

Y, yes, Sir!{end}

General Imelda!
Reinforcements have arrived!{end}

Right on time ...
Now, please deal with
this redheaded whelp.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

General Imelda!?{06}{07}
You're quite strong if you
can defeat General Imelda.{06}{07}
For the honour of the
Water Dragon Navy,
we can't let you live!{06}{07}
Prepare to die, boy.{end}

Yes, forgive me.{end}

Yes, forgive me.{end}

Feel the power of
the Water Dragon Navy!{end}

What!?
An ambush?{end}

You spot a water fowl perched
atop a nearby small post.{06}{07}

The bird is holding a small,
glittering stone in its beak.{06}{07}

What will you do?{end}

Startle it{end}

Reach out{end}

Ignore it{end}

The water bird gets scared,
drops the stone and flies away.{06}{07}

The stone sinks to the
bottom of the lake.{end}

The bird drops the stone
in your hand and flies away.{06}{07}

You wash the stone and
it emits a mysterious glow.{06}{07}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

The bird finally flies away.{end}

Everyone, ...
please run away.{end}

Damn!
This is it ...{end}

Ha ha ha!
What a humiliating defeat!{end}

Ouch!
I can't fight like this.
Sorry I can't hold them back ...{end}

Prepare yourself!{end}

Ugh ...
That was a mistake ...{end}

I'm sorry ...{end}

Damn!
Of all the places!{end}

Damn!
Not too shabby!{end}

Inside the fortress!
Quickly now!{end}

Y, yes!{end}

No one will enter
this fortress!{06}{07}
If you want to take it, you
will have to deal with me first!
While I yet draw breath,
I will not move a single step!{end}

Lord Aaron!
What will become of us?{end}

Don't worry.
Leave it to me.{end}

Oh my!{06}{07}
How could I ever lay a hand
on such helpless people!{06}{07}
If I ever killed them,
how would I face myself?{end}

Do you promise you
won't attack them?{end}

Yes, I promise!{end}

Fine, ... in that case ...{end}

Everyone, ...
leave this fortress and
evacuate to a safer place.{end}

Yes.{end}

I really do pity you,
but you shall die!{end}

Indeed, I'm too old for this ...{end}

Sir Aaron!
Are you okay?{06}{07}
We're here to help!
Please fall back for now!{end}

Ugh, sorry ...{end}

Help!{end}

Hey you, Imperial scum!{end}

Ahhh!
My life is ...{end}

Thank you, General Imelda.{end}

Get out quickly!
I'll kill you myself if you
don't move fast enough!{end}

No ... No ...
I don't want to die ...{end}

Don't get on my nerves!
You still haven't killed
that old fart!?{06}{07}
You're a totally useless
bunch of imbeciles.
If you don't hurry it up,
I'll have your heads!{end}

Well then, I'll send you
all to your doom!{end}

Eeeek!
What impudence!{end}

I, impossible ...{06}{07}
How can someone as
strong and beautiful
as me be defeated?
I'm retreating!{end}

Are you all right,
Master Swordsman?{end}

What!?
These old bones won't lose to
some group of young upstarts.{end}

What the ...!?
These old bones won't
lose to some young ...{06}{07}
Ouch ...
I am getting too old for this.{end}

Master!
Are you all right?{end}

Of course.
I won't be beaten so easily.{end}

Master!
Are you all right?{end}

Somehow ...{end}

Cherie, you seem
healthier than ever.{end}

M, master ...
Are you all right ...?{end}

Cherie!
You haven't trained enough!
Your form is pathetic ...{end}

Master ...
Are you all right ...?{end}

What about you, Master Aaron?
It seems neither of us
have trained enough.{end}

Sorry ...{end}

Huh ...
So this old chap is Cherie's
weapons teacher?{end}

So this old guy is Cherie's
fighting instructor ...?{end}

Hey Cherie ...
So he's your sword master?{end}

Master Aaron?{end}

Well, it's been a while since
you've visited, if I recall ...{end}

Truth is ...{end}

Truth is ...{end}

I already know.
It's about the Empire ...{06}{07}
Lately, it seems they've
been up to something.
All this is troubling me ...{end}

And those Imperial fiends ...{06}{07}
Lately, it seems the Empire
has been up to something.
All this is troubling me ...{end}

That's reassuring.{end}

Aaron joins the entourage!{end}

Hey!
We don't have time for a break.{06}{07}
If we sit here, the Empire will
take Langrisser before us.{end}

Impatient, aren't you?{end}

Let's hurry!
We can't let the Imperial Army
get their hands on Langrisser!{end}

This will be your final
resting place!{end}

Gah!
I've been injured ...{end}

G, General Imelda!{end}

This is a total defeat ...{end}

I don't want to die yet--!{end}

Gaa--!{end}

Let's go!
It's time to begin the slaughter!{end}

R, regrettably ...{end}

You won't cross this bridge!{end}

Such strength.
But how ...?{end}

Charge!{end}

Why?
Why can't I win ...?{end}

Protect General Imelda!
Charge!{end}

No, that can't be!{end}

Damn it!
I screwed up!{end}

Ugh--!
Some rest at last.{end}

Master!{end}

Oh, isn't that Cherie?
So, your skill has improved?{end}

Yes!
This is a good occasion, Master.{06}{07}
I could show you a few
things now, I'd bet!{end}

Hmmm,
it's been a while
since I've fought.{06}{07}
I just exhausted myself.
Let's rest for a while ...{end}

It's been a while
since I've fought.{06}{07}
I just exhausted myself.
Let's rest for a while ...{end}

Attack if you dare,
but you won't pass!{end}

How awful!
How could anyone
be so cruel?{end}

Imelda is a cruel General.
I've heard that she'll do just
about anything to win ...{end}

What are you doing!
Stop that immediately!{end}

Ha ha ha!
Where do you think you are?{06}{07}
You're on the battlefield!
Here, only the strong survive ...
Weak fools have no right.{end}

You don't agree, redhead?{end}

Strength is for
protecting the weak!{06}{07}
People like you have no
right to speak of strength!{end}

My, my ...
What a poetic little
boy you are.{06}{07}
However, I don't care
about your silly beliefs.
I will crush you all!{end}

What the hell is taking so long?
The Water Dragon Navy
has no room for weaklings!{end}

What, Langrisser!?
The Holy Blade ...?{end}

Yeah, that's the one.{06}{07}
Anyway, we can talk
about it as we walk.
Let's go, everyone!{end}

By the way, seeing you battle
made me realise how long it's
been since I've last fought...{06}{07}
Thank you for helping me out.
It is very inspiring to see
youngsters like you striking
back against those Imperials...{06}{07}
I would like to return
the help you gave.
I am inviting myself
to join your group!{end}

Sir Aaron is the man
who taught me to use
a sword properly.{end}
