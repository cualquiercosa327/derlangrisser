Everyone, listen up!
I'm ordering
a full evacuation.{06}{07}
This town will soon become
a battlefield. Please
leave as soon as possible.{end}

What about you, Princess
Cherie? Aren't you coming?{end}

I must remain and fend
off the Empire. We can't let
them get Langrisser.{06}{07}
Forgive me, everyone ...
I didn't want the
war to come here, but ...{end}

Princess ...{end}

If you don't leave
you'll be caught in the melee!
Everyone, please hurry!{end}

I'll handle the protection
of the villagers, Princess!{end}

Eh ...!{end}

Princess, we've
spotted the enemy!{end}

All right! Everyone get
into position and
prepare for the ambush!{end}

Well well, what do we have
here? It seems Cherie has
decided to stage an ambush!{end}

The civilians are still
evacuating. What should
we do, {02}?{end}

What a royal pain in the ass.
I say we just take
the civilians out as well.{end}

I will have
none of that talk.{06}{07}
Our aim is to forever rid
this world of bloodshed.
The killing of innocents goes
against His Majesty's wishes.{end}

Exactly. We can't let our
troops harm the civilians.{end}

So you've come, {02}!{06}{07}
Even though you may be a 
Descendant of Light, I won't
give up Langrisser to you!{end}

We will see about that!
Let's go, Cherie!{end}

Despite the situation,
this town's layout is
perfect for an ambush.{end}

Fighting in the streets will
restrict our movement.{06}{07}
Be careful when moving
your subordinates.{end}

You're right.
We should take extra care
concerning the cavalry.{end}

What about the
Serpent Knights?{end}

If we engage water units
on land, we should be okay,
wouldn't you think?{end}

Yes, we should be.{end}

What's the matter? Is the
little pink princess giving
our Generals some trouble!?{end}

General Vargas?{06}{07}
Well, if you look
closely, the situation is
more troublesome than
we had anticipated.{end}

If I left my fellow
officers in this mess, I
wouldn't be fit to look my
newborn child in the eye!{06}{07}
Hmph, I guess I'll
just have to rescue you, then!{06}{07}
Gah hah hah!
Here I come, girlie ...
Get ready for a knock out.{end}

General Vargas ...{end}

Heh, don't think that
I've forgiven you
for what you've done!{06}{07}
However, if it is the will of
His Majesty for me to help you,
then I shall follow your orders.{06}{07}
That's the duty
of any soldier.{06}{07}
But that's as far as our
alliance goes! If it even
looks like you might betray us,
I'll cut you down.{end}

Hey, you little punks!
I've heard the news, from now
on let's be friends!{end}

Vargas joins the entourage!{end}

Hmmm, ... such strong allies.
Finally a group
worthy of my strength.{end}

And a little dangerous.{end}

He sure has a
heart for battle,
don't you think?{end}

So even General Vargas
is here ... That really puts
us into a bind.{06}{07}
But I don't plan on letting up.
You'll never get by me!{end}

I am a spirit of the water.{06}{07}

I will bestow upon
you wonderful power.{06}{07}

What would you
request of me?{end}

Increase AT and DF{end}

Increase MP{end}

Increase Magic Resistance{end}

AT raised by 1 point!
DF raised by 1 point!{end}

MP raised by 5 points!{end}

Magic Resistance raised!{end}

Put down your sword, Cherie!
I don't want to hurt you!{end}

That's my line!
If you surrender now,
I'll forgive you!{end}

I have no choice ...
Here I come, Cherie!{end}

{02}, why, why have
you teamed up with
the likes of the Empire?{end}

For peace.  I've always fought
to end war, and this seems the
best way to go about that.{end}

So you're saying that if you
stayed with us, we couldn't
create a peaceful society?{06}{07}
Don't you dare say
such a thing, {02}!{end}

Im, impossible ...
That it should ...
end this way--{end}

Cherie, please give up. 
You'll only hurt yourself
further if you continue.{end}

Don't insult me!
Do you really think
you can best me!?{end}

I'm sorry, I failed ...{end}

If you mess with us,
you'll get hurt!{end}

You're in the way!
Move it!{end}

Damn!
Sorry!{end}

Heh, how futile ...{end}

Even though you
may be a woman, I won't
go easy on you!{06}{07}
Prepare yourself!{end}

For me to have fallen ...{end}

Have at you!{end}

Hmph, what a spirited
princess you are.{end}

I wonder if you can even
come close to beating me.{end}

How dare you!{06}{07}
I have no choice. 
I'm out of here!{end}

Let me see how
serious you are!{end}

Let's go,
young wench!{end}

Brute strength is
no match for experience!{end}

Argh! It's not over ...{end}

Vargas!{06}{07}
If anything happens to you,
Lady Eliza will not forgive us.
Please, pull out of here!{end}

Vargas, please
get out of here.{06}{07}
But next time you are needed,
please lend us your strength!{end}

Guys, sorry ...
Thanks for
covering my hide.{end}

I'm really sorry.
To chase you out of your
homes like this ...{end}

Oh, no.{06}{07}
We are happy to do
as you request, Princess.{06}{07}
But isn't it possible
that we might be killed
while escaping?{end}

It's all right.{06}{07}
If {02} is here,
he'll make sure no one
lays a finger on you.{06}{07}
The Empire may be an enemy,
but marauders they are not.
Their aim is peace,
much like ours is.{06}{07}
Now, hurry and
get out of here!{end}

Very well.{end}

We're saved.
Princess Cherie,
please be safe!{end}

There's no
need to worry!
Take care.{end}

Thank you very much.{end}

Whew! We're
praying for your
victory, Princess!{end}

Thank you.
I'll do my best!{end}

Farewell, Princess Cherie.
Please, don't die on us ...{end}

It seems as if I'm
all alone, doesn't it?{06}{07}
For once in my life,
I wish I'd paid more attention
to all those boring old 
strategy books.{06}{07}
But I guess I'll just make
do. I'll try my
hardest from here on out!{end}

Ooh ...
Any more and
I'm toast.{06}{07}
No choice but to flee.{end}

Hmm?
It seems as if we
were too late.{end}

Yeah, we all put
our backs into it, heh.{end}

That should be the end of it.
So why aren't we off
to chase the enemy, already?{end}

Vargas, your help today
was much appreciated.{06}{07}
Please return to Lady Eliza
quickly, for her sake.{end}

Vargas, the fight
is already over.{06}{07}
Return and
watch over Eliza.{end}

That's right.{06}{07}
Too much anxiety can be
hard on a woman, particularly
considering what she's
going through.{end}

Heh, seems you won't
accept my help under these
circumstances, eh?{end}

There's no need to worry.{06}{07}
This is for a glorious
child of the Empire.{end}

Guys, I'm sorry.{06}{07}
Once the child is born,
I'll rush back to fight with you.
Until then, stay safe.{end}

Vargas leaves the entourage ...{end}

It's over ...{end}

General Leon!{end}

Colonel Laird has
discovered Castle Baldea!{end}

I see. So he found it ...
Good work.{end}

Castle Baldea?
Finally, we'll get our
hands on Langrisser.{end}

Onward!{06}{07}
I'll trust you in
leading the way!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Don't let the
enemy through!{end}

Not ... yet ...{end}

I entrust you with
escorting the villagers
out safely!{06}{07}
Take care that they
don't get caught up
in the battle!{end}

Understood!{end}

Mission complete.
Now we're off
to join the battle!{end}

Okay!
But don't go overboard!{end}

Understood!{end}

Take no prisoners!{end}

Ugh, very good ...{end}

Woah!{end}

To die in such ...
a ... place--!{end}

You mock me!
However, don't think that
alone shall get you past!{end}

Aim for the enemy's
weak point and attack
at once! Now, go!{end}

Ugh!{end}

Gaahh!{end}

Let's go!
Chase them from
this village!{end}

Im, impossible ...{end}

No ...{end}

Is, is this the end ...?{end}

General Vargas,
shouldn't you be
with Lady Eliza?{06}{07}
The birth of your child
is a very important time.{end}

These eyes saw
one set escape.{06}{07}
There should be
one more left ...{end}

With this, the civilians
should have left
the village safely ...{end}
