Father, I have
come as you requested.{end}

Ah, good.
We have just received some
troubling news.{06}{07}
It seems that {02} has
left Lady Cherie's side.
He is working with the Empire.{end}

You cannot be serious!{end}

That is not all.
He has taken Langrisser.{end}

For the Imperials?{end}

I see ...{06}{07}
Things have become
quite grim, have they not?{end}

They have ...{end}

As things stand,
Cherie and her group
are in great danger.{06}{07}
We must send our
army for Kalxath.
I shall lead the way!{end}

Well said.
Your spirit brings me
pride, my son.{end}

You speak too highly
of me, Father.
It's embarrassing ...{end}

Anyway, I will leave now
and marshal our forces.{end}

Has it been ten years
since he came to this
house as an orphan ...?{06}{07}
He has grown to be a
splendid young man.{end}

Lord Loren, I don't
believe my own eyes ...{06}{07}
A horde of demons lays
siege to our mansion ... and
{02} commands them.{end}

No, ... that can't be ...{06}{07}
Has this world gone mad!?
Where is the Empire?{end}

Sound the alarm!
All soldiers, assume
defensive stations.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Loren, our business is
with Kalxath. Let us pass.{end}

The day Salrath
yields to demons is
the day I fall dead.{06}{07}
Not one of you
will cross our line.{end}

So many pointless battles ...
Well, no choice.  Time to cut
down a few more adversaries.{end}

We were such fools ...
Putting our faith in a
blackguard like you.{06}{07}
At least you're finally
with your kindred, right?
Bloodthirsty demons seem more
suitable companions.{end}

No one we meet has
a brain in their head.{06}{07}
If you surrender, we will pass.
If you don't, we will slaughter
any and all resistance.{06}{07}
Loren, you're a wise man.
Make a wise decision.{end}

Father, ... please
don't listen to him.{end}

Do not worry, my son.{06}{07}
You think Salrath can't fend off
a few yellow-livered monsters?{06}{07}
We scrape things fiercer
than them off our boots.{06}{07}
Scott, remember my
instructions in war ...{06}{07}
The correct strategy will
bring any foe to his knees.
One must simply find it!{end}

Only a few men hold
the mansion's interior.{end}

Is that really all they have?
Salrath disappoints me.{06}{07}
Maybe we can cut them down
without a single casualty.{end}

Everyone, remember,
if this drags on, word
will get to Kalxath.{06}{07}
We need to make
excellent use of our time.{end}

Against our military strength,
Kalxath means nothing.{end}

Don't be hasty, Rohga.
We must pursue the
best available strategy.{06}{07}
We took this detour to
surprise Kalxath, and we may
lose that advantage.{06}{07}
How can we
solve this quickly?{end}

Well, spell-casting should
be very effective here!{06}{07}
The right magic should
make this battle a snap.{end}

Understood. Hein, I
need you to support our
forward squads.{end}

Under these conditions, we
should hold back and
exploit our strong position.{06}{07}
Scott, there may be an
opening during the battle.
Escape as soon as you see it.{end}

We can do better than that!
Allow us to create a diversion.{end}

Hmmm ...
Yes, please do.{end}

Everyone, thank you.{end}

I ask one last time.
Will you surrender?{end}

Hah hah hah!
What good would that do?
What future would we have?{06}{07}
Cowering in fear under
a cut-throat tyrant and his
slavering demons?{06}{07}
I think you've used
up your capital with us, sir,
and not very prudently.{end}

I am loyal to
Father and to Salrath.{06}{07}
And {02}, by throwing
in with fiends,
you're no friend of either!{end}

So, death then.
That choice has become
quite popular ...{end}

Scott, ... our enemies are
far stronger than expected.{06}{07}
You must escape when the
chance arrives and
meet our friends at Kalxath.{06}{07}
Tell them {02} has
taken arms with darkness ...
and seeks to ruin us all.{end}

But, what about you?{end}

This is not just our problem.
The fate of the entire
continent lies with you.{06}{07}
Understand, Scott.
Escape when you can.{end}

No, Scott can't leave!
If Kalxath learns our plan,
then they'll be prepared.{end}

Damn it all ...
This is troublesome.{end}

Yes, we've broken through!{end}

Good work, Scott.{end}

Rest easy, Father.
I will ensure our
victory at Kalxath.{end}

Father, ... watch from 
the heavens, and witness our
victory at Kalxath.{end}

Imperial troops, hmm?
My men are far superior.{end}

Scott ...
Don't be careless.{06}{07}
Kalxath plays at friendship,
but they thirst for power
just as much as the Empire.{06}{07}
That's why the two have had
such poor relations.
Just read your history.{end}

Several obscure characters
are carved into the slate.{06}{07}

"If you want, offer me a prayer.
I will grant your fond desire."{06}{07}

What do you desire?{end}

More troops{end}

Attack power{end}

Defence power{end}

Troops raised.{end}

AT raised by 1 point.{end}

DF raised by 1 point.{end}

{02}, have
you sold your soul!?{06}{07}
Why are you commanding
a horde of monsters!?{end}

I accept any assistance
in unifying the
continent, man or demon.{end}

Persistent bastards ...
Loren, have you any idea how
insignificant your army is?{end}

Look around at my manor.
If you think we will surrender,
then you must be dreaming!{06}{07}
We are all prepared to
lay down our lives to stop you
and your minions, {02}!{end}

Th, this world ...
Is this the end ...?{end}

You have no chance!{end}

Salrath's men ...
are dedicated ...!{end}

Thinking about attacking me?
You have some nerve.{end}

Damn it, my good hand--!
You'll pay for that!{end}

Your peace is one where
humans treat demons like dirt!
I will never accept that!{end}

You rotten, tricky ...
damned humans ...
Don't be so arrogant ...!{end}

{font3}Humans, die!{end}

{font3}Uuggghhh--!{end}

{font3}Aaaah ...!{end}

We will not tolerate
your vicious bloodshed
any longer, {02}!{end}

Until Scott's safe escape,
we must not lose!{end}

Uuggghh--!
Is this the best I could do!?
Scott, forgive me ...{06}{07}
Whatever happens,
don't follow the fate
of your Father ...{end}

Father!
Please, hang on!{end}

Scott, continue to learn.
Always improve your tactics, 
and travel the Knight's path.{06}{07}
I have no regrets. Save that ...
you'd had the chance to be an
ordinary child, for a time ...{end}

Father ... 
What are you talking about?{06}{07}
Even though I was
an orphan, you raised
me as a true son.{06}{07}
You're the best
father I could have
wished for!{end}

Thank you, Scott. 
You've indulged an old man's
ego till the very end ...{06}{07}
Swear to tell ... 
Kalxath ...  {06}{07}
The rest, the rest ... 
I leave to you ... my son ...{end}

Father!{06}{07}
I swear I'll get to Kalxath.
Please, watch over me.{end}

Uuggghhh ...
Scott ... I'm done for ...
Everything rides ... on you ...{end}

Father!{06}{07}
I swear I'll get to Kalxath.
Please, watch over me.{end}

Alas, even Salrath cannot
escape its own end ...{06}{07}
My apologies, dear Scott ...
Please ... avenge us ...{end}

Leave now, Scott!
Go to Kalxath!{end}

I will, Father.
Please stay safe.{end}

I will do my best.
Thank you.{end}

Father, I must set out
for Kalxath immediately!{end}

I won't be beaten here!{end}

Aarrgghh--!{end}

Scott!{end}

Forgive me ...
Father ...{06}{07}
I trained hard, ...
but it wasn't enough ...{end}

Scott ...?
Stand up, Scott!{end}

You raised and cared for a
nameless orphan like me ...
I humbly thank you for that.{06}{07}
And after all you've done, ...
I've repaid you
with my wasteful death ...{06}{07}
For my Father's best efforts ...
For this world ...
I die ... Forgive me.{end}

Scccotttt!{06}{07}
I've never thought you
any less than my own child.{06}{07}
Even if we've different
blood, you will
always be my son.{06}{07}
That's ...
That's why ... {06}{07}
Damn you, monsters!
You'll know a father's
vengeance for his child!{end}

{02}, why ...
why have you ...
joined the darkness ...?{end}

I simply use means as
they become available, just
like a humble merchant.{06}{07}
Do not worry yourself.
Soon, this continent
will know my benevolent rule.{end}

Darkness ... will bring ...
this world to Hell ...
Don't you ... know ...{end}

I will protect
Loren and Scott!{end}

At the least,
we must protect Scott!{end}

Aaahh--!{end}

Die!{end}

Uuggghh--!
Is this the end for
me, too ...?{end}

No ...
What are you saying ...?{end}

L, Lord--!{end}

Uugghhh ...!
My life is over ...
alread--?{end}

I couldn't protect Scott ...{end}

M, my mission ...{end}

Grrr, die!{end}

We've been defeated ...{end}

Everyone, I'm sorry.{end}

Please hurry, Lord Scott!
I can't hold them much longer.{end}

All right, we did it!{end}

Ugh, what a disaster.
I'm exhausted.
{end}

We did what
had to be done.{06}{07}
Still, it must be hard
on you and Hein
to kill old comrades.{end}

Moreover, Cherie's group
is next on our list ...{end}

Salrath has fallen, and
Kalxath will soon follow.{end}

Let's keep up the pace!{end}

We'll depart for
Kalxath at once!{end}

Damn it!
They got away!{end}

We've lost this war.
Taking Castle Kalxath will
now be impossible ...{end}

We should have
considered our tactics
more prudently.{end}
