Cherie, how much further
to the magician's home?{end}

I believe it should be
just beyond this bridge.{end}

She's over seven hundred
years old ... I wonder. What
kind of person could she be?{end}

Everyone, come on!
Let's hurry!{end}

Excited, aren't you, Hein?{end}

Of course!
To meet such a magic user is
a once in a lifetime chance!{06}{07}
If you're all going to
drag your feet, then
I'll run on ahead!{end}

Halt, you bastards!{end}

Me ...?{end}

You fucking Imperials!
You'll cross this bridge
over my dead body!{end}

Just a minute!
We're not the Imperial Army.{06}{07}
We just came to meet
with the renowned magician.
Let us pass!{end}

I won't allow some party
of strangers from nowhere
to meet Jessica.{06}{07}
Get out of my sight!{end}

Wait a moment!{end}

I'm the princess of
Kalxath, Cherie.{06}{07}
We came a long way to
see the great magician.
Could you please
show us the way?{end}

You expect me to believe
you're the princess of
Kalxath? Don't bullshit me!{06}{07}
Why would the princess ever
come to such a remote region?{06}{07}
Wiggle back wherever you came
from, cutie, before my lonely
mates here start getting ideas.{end}

What was that--!?{end}

If there's anything I can
count on never to change,
it's your hospitality.{06}{07}
Long time no see, Lester.{end}

You're ...
Oh man, Keith!
It's really Keith!{06}{07}
So that girl ... really
is the princess?{end}

Indeed.{end}

Forgive my rudeness,
Princess. Keith told
me a lot about you.{end}

A lot ...?
Like what?{end}

Um, well ...{end}

Nothing much!
You're better off not knowing.{end}

Keith ...
I'm going to hurt you.{end}

Well, well ...
settle down, Princess!
I'll guide you to Jessica!{end}

Hey mates, stay here
and guard the area.{end}

Aye aye, boss!{end}

Lady Jessica!
These people were
looking for you.{end}

Welcome, everyone.
I am Jessica.{end}

What!?
This is the woman who has
lived for hundreds of years ...?{06}{07}
She looks so ... young!{end}

Pleased to meet you,
Jessica, I'm {02}.{06}{07}
We needed some advice,
so we came here to see you.
To tell the truth ...{end}

It's about the
Dark Blade ... isn't it?{06}{07}
Then I imagine you want
to know where you can
find the Dark Rod.{end}

Amazing.
How does she do that?{end}

A wave of evil is rippling
across our world.{06}{07}
The Imperial Army has begun
invasions everywhere.{06}{07}
All this negative energy is a
sign Alhazard is being used
for the Kaiser's ambitions.{end}

Amazing!
She already knows so much ...{end}

Despite this, Alhazard is
not at its strongest yet.{06}{07}
You must prevent it from
awakening to its true form.{end}

That is why we want
to get hold of the
Dark Rod before the Empire!{06}{07}
We want to prevent more
damage from being done!{end}

The Dark Rod is enshrined in
the Sanctuary of Reitel.{end}

The Sanctuary of Reitel, eh?
Hmmm ...{end}

Ha ha ha!
I see ...{06}{07}
I would have never
guessed to look there.{end}

That voice--!?
Egbert!{end}

E, Egbert!?{06}{07}
The legendary magician who
supports the Rayguard
Empire from the shadows?{06}{07}
The unknown man who
follows the evil ways!{end}

I've heard of him too ...{06}{07}
He's not only a powerful
magician, but also a
mighty strategist.{06}{07}
He's convinced many
countries to surrender
to the Empire.{end}

Oh ...?
My reputation precedes me.{06}{07}
However, now that I
know where the Dark Rod
is, your usefulness has
come to an end.{06}{07}
You all shall perish here.{end}

Egbert!
Stop this!{end}

He he he ...{06}{07}
If you're so intent on helping
them, I'm afraid you'll share
their fate, Jessica.{end}

Egbert!
You asshole ...{06}{07}
How dare you show your face
in front of Jessica again!
Your evil bullshit ends here!{end}

Sigh ...
Lester, what are you thinking?{06}{07}
I've already sent your
little "mates" to hell.
Are you planning to end
their loneliness?{end}

What the fuck!?
I'll never forgive you!{06}{07}
You son of a bitch,
I'll wring your neck until
your head pops off!
Prepare to die!{end}

Sigh ... idiot!
Do you really think I
would come here alone?{end}

Master Egbert!
The preparations for
our plan are complete.{end}

What?
Something smells like oil ...{end}

Watch out!
He's planning something!{end}

Two detachments of the
Water Dragon Navy are here by
order of General Imelda.{06}{07}
We've come to give you backup.{end}

You're just in time.
Engage them at once.{end}

Yes, Sir!
You can depend on us.{end}

Please listen to me,
General Vargas!{06}{07}
I can't let you get in
trouble on my behalf.{06}{07}
Besides, as the strongest
group of magicians in the
Empire, we have our pride.{06}{07}
It would affect master
Egbert's reputation if we
relied on your help.{end}

What should we do, General?{06}{07}
We don't have the forces
we need to win this fight.{06}{07}
All we can do is
rely on our tactics ...{end}

It's already been decided.
We can't let these valiant
warriors die now, can we?{end}

I understand ...
Then I, Colonel Zorum, will
show you all of my power!{end}

You find a question
scrawled at your feet.{06}{07}

"Could you abandon someone
who would fight to his death?"{06}{07}

"Who would give all to protect
you? I doubt you could ..."{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

Gahh--!
To have come so far ...{end}

How cruel ...
To have given me so
many cuts and bruises ...{end}

Ah--!?
I'm losing my concentration.
Sorry, but I must retreat!{end}

Wah, shit!
I can't fall here!
I'll withdraw.{end}

Ugh ...
I made a mistake.{end}

Shit!
I was too careless.{end}

Egbert ...{06}{07}
You seem intent on
breaking the seal of
Alhazard at any cost ...{end}

Oh!
So you finally noticed?{06}{07}
However, Jessica, since you
have just been reborn, you and
I both know you lack the
strength to stop me.{end}

Indeed ...{06}{07}
With the magic of Rebirth, a
magician can abandon her
old body and be reborn anew ...{06}{07}
Yet it's at the cost of her
magic power, which is reduced
to that of a novice.{06}{07}
Still, ... while I may be weak,
I can't overlook your
attempts to revive Alhazard!{end}

Is that right ...?
Then I won't hold back, teacher.
You'll share their fate!{end}

No way!
As long as I'm here,
you'll never touch her!{end}

Then the easiest
solution seems to be
making you "not here."{end}

The Empire is serious
about breaking the seal
on Alhazard.{end}

Hurry!
We can't allow the Empire
to take the Dark Rod!{end}

Miss Jessica!
I'll cover your back.
Please, stay near {02}.{end}

Thank you, Lester.
I will try to stay near him.{end}

Ahh--!
The sky is so blue ...{end}

Damn!
I couldn't protect her!{end}

Everyone has given so much
to keep protecting me ...
It's my turn to fight, too!{end}

Liana!{end}

I'm sorry ...
I wasn't able to help you ...{end}

Don't worry about fighting.
Worry about your safety and
leave the battle to us.{end}

I'm so sorry ...{end}

Pathetic ...
These maggots will die even
without my intervention.{06}{07}
Well then, I'll be off to Reitel.{end}

Camilla, come along when
you've finished with them.{end}

Understood!{end}

You dare attack me ...?{end}

I never imagined you kids
had so much power ...
However, it matters not.{06}{07}
I shall still reach Reitel
before you can stop me!{end}

But first, let me pay you
back for this scratch.{end}

Camilla, the rest is
in your hands.
Let no one escape.{end}

Leave it to me, Sir.{end}

You can't let them escape.{end}

Yes, Sir!
Understood.{end}

Don't let them escape!{end}

Even with General Vargas'
help, I still ...
My duty is complete ...{06}{07}
Egbert must have
gotten it by now ...
The Dark Rod ... {06}{07}
Gahh--!{end}

You ... can hurry ...
in vain ...{06}{07}
By now Egbert must have
gotten ... the Dark Rod ...
Argh--!{end}

Damn, how could you!?
There's no other choice,
we must retreat!{end}

But, General Vargas!
We can still fight easily.{06}{07}
And the enemy has lost most
of their main force.
Victory can still be ours!{end}

Stop it!
The flames are rising.{06}{07}
Staying here is dangerous.
A soldier shouldn't throw
away his life just to beat
one lowly enemy.{06}{07}
There's no glory in
burning to death.
Besides, we've got a job to do.{06}{07}
Fall back!{end}

Yes, Sir!
I'll follow your command.{end}

Farewell, kids ...
You better hurry!{end}

One day I'll avenge Zorum,
but for now, I have
more pressing orders.{06}{07}
I can't wait here forever ...{end}

You kids better stay alive!{06}{07}
I intend to take your
rotting skulls as a
grave offering for Zorum!{06}{07}
Enjoy your short lives ...
while they last.{end}

Excellent spirit, kids!
But next time we meet,
it will be your end!{end}

Damn!
I can't believe Camilla
was beaten ...{end}

They're too strong!
Retreat!{end}

Damn it!
What a shame ...
I have to withdraw!{end}

Damn!
There's no choice
but to withdraw!{end}

You, how could you do this ...?{end}

We can't let them go!
Kill them all!
No matter what it takes!{end}

Have you lost your mind!?
You'll be burned alive if you
try something so reckless.{end}

You think so!?
I don't care if I burn.{06}{07}
Since the day I enlisted, I've
been willing to lay down my
life for the Kaiser's dream!{06}{07}
Let's go!
It's time for you to die!{end}

Aaah ...
I'm dying ...{end}

If we fail today ... we'll never
be able to face General Imelda.{06}{07}
In the name of the
Water Dragon Navy, we must
not be defeated!{end}

Imelda ...?
Who is she?{06}{07}
Someone fearful, no doubt.{end}

General Imelda commands
the largest division of the
Water Dragon Navy.{06}{07}
Rumours say she's an
especially cruel, cold
and unforgiving woman.{end}

The Water Dragon Navy?
We'll deal with them later.{06}{07}
First, we have to break through
this line and get to Reitel!{end}

How am I defeated--?{end}

Gahh--!{end}

I can't have come so far ...
only to die--?{end}

Wahhh!
Mummy ...!{end}

Ha ha ha!
This place will be your grave!{end}

Zorum!
Your opponents are strong!
Don't be careless!{end}

What are you saying, General?
There's no way that I, Zorum,
can be weaker than mere kids.{end}

Let's go!{end}

It's no use!
You can't defeat me with
such a pathetic attack!{end}

Gah ...
This is ... blood?{06}{07}
Those kids ...
How could they have ...?
I--!?{end}

Zorum!
Fool! What did I say about
not being careless!?{end}

Heh heh ...
Sorry General, this time, my
brashness was inexcusable.{06}{07}
I never imagined that these
kids could be so powerful ...{06}{07}
Seems like this will be our
last battle together, General.{end}

You can't die!
I won't allow it!{06}{07}
As your commander, it's my
job to decide when and
where your life should end!
You can't die!{end}

General Vargas ...
I will be waiting on the front
lines of the next world ...{end}

Zorum ...
Commander Zorum ...
You died with honour.{06}{07}
Don't worry, friend.
Your sacrifice won't be in vain!{end}

Here I come, kids.
It's time to revisit the defeat
at Kalxath on you ten fold.{end}

Hold, General Vargas!{06}{07}
As a ranking officer in the
Dark Dragon Sorcerers,
I must uphold the
honour of my division.{06}{07}
I cannot accept your help.{end}

Listen, Camilla.
I came upon this battle while
on another mission.{06}{07}
I won't disrupt your operations.
I'll fight here by myself.{end}

Thank you, General ...
I won't forget this.{end}

Those damn kids!{end}

General, please retreat!{end}

Fine.
If there's no other choice ...{end}

General!{end}

Yes!{end}

General Vargas!{end}

The oil's causing the fire
to spread rapidly.{06}{07}
If we keep fighting here,
we'll all be torched alive!{end}

Lady Jessica, please follow me!
I'll take out all the enemies
blocking our escape!{end}

Very well!{end}

{02}, take care of her.{end}

By the way, Lady Jessica.
Would you be my mentor?{06}{07}
To tell the truth, I'm a student
and would appreciate
the chance to be such
a famous magician's pupil!{end}

Hein, I'm curious, could you
possibly have picked a worse
time to ask her about this?{06}{07}
We should be worrying
about the fire right now.{end}

But if we're all going to
die anyway, this may be my
only chance to ask her!{06}{07}
Cherie, you don't understand ...
My future depends on me
finding a proper mentor.{end}

Sorry ...
I no longer accept students.{end}

What!?
Why ...{end}

Hey, cheer up!
Don't be so disappointed ...{end}

You will go no further!{end}

You think I
will be easy prey?{end}

I'm fine ...
It's just a flesh wound!{end}

You can't fight with a
wound like that!{06}{07}
Please retreat, and leave
the enemy for us!{end}

Sorry, the rest ...
is up to you.{end}

{02}, that's foolish.
The Imperial Army
is after Liana.{06}{07}
It's far too dangerous to send
her back to Kalxath alone.{06}{07}
We don't have the time
or the manpower to escort
her to Kalxath.{end}

Please, {02}!
I want to fight alongside you ...{06}{07}
I know I might be a burden
on you, but I don't want to
be alone ever again ...{end}

Wait!{end}

He used the Teleport spell.{06}{07}
We need to get moving
or he'll escape.
We can't let Egbert get
hold of the Dark Rod.{end}

It seems the odds
are against you.{06}{07}
We can't leave the
Dark Dragon Sorcerers
in such a mess.{06}{07}
Zorum, let us help them.{end}

Yes!{end}

General Vargas, you
needn't protect our
humble group.{06}{07}
I'm the unit commander.
They won't escape,
even if we have to fight
to the last man.{end}

You need to learn
to accept favours.{06}{07}
There's no use for pride
in this kind of situation.{end}

Damn ...
Now, of all times!{end}

{02}, don't let
yourself lose hope!{06}{07}
Swear by your circlet that
you'll have courage.{end}

What ...?
What does my circlet have
to do with anything?{end}

We'll talk about it later.
First, we have to get
out of here.{end}

Is everyone okay?{end}

Somehow, we're still alive.{end}

However, now that the enemy
knows where the Dark Rod is,
we can't stay here.{06}{07}
I'll aid you with my magic.{end}

Thank you.{end}

Which means I've got a chance
to show my strength too.{end}

I screwed up this time,
but watch out!{06}{07}
Next time I'll defeat the enemy
before you can even blink!{end}

Lester joins the entourage!{end}

By the way, we were talking
about your circlet before ...{end}

This circlet is a memento
of my deceased father.{06}{07}
I guess it's been
passed down through my
family for generations.{06}{07}
What's so important about it?{end}

Let me answer you.{06}{07}
Once, long ago, I served
a certain royal family.
Their prince had a circlet
just like yours.{end}

My swordplay instructor,
Doren, once told me a
story like that.{06}{07}
I didn't think it was true.{06}{07}
Then I really am a descendant
of the Baldean royal family?{end}

Yes, and you are one
who is guided by Light.{06}{07}
Those guided by Light are
chosen soldiers, destined to
defeat enemies in a war over
Alhazard, the cursed sword.{06}{07}
It is fated for the
Descendants of Light to
wage war against
whoever wields Alhazard.{end}

I see ...{06}{07}
I'll stop the revival of
Alhazard not just because
it's my fate, but for the
peace of the land.{06}{07}
If the Empire gains the power
of Alhazard, war will erupt
across the continent.{06}{07}
That's why I have
to stop the Empire.{end}

By the way, Liana,
what will you do now?{06}{07}
If you follow us further,
only danger lies ahead ...{end}

Liana.{06}{07}
Remember ...?
You promised to
return to Kalxath.{end}

...{end}

...{end}

He's right.{06}{07}
We can't just let Egbert ...
or the Empire obtain
the Dark Rod.{06}{07}
We have no time to waste.
We should hurry to Reitel.{end}

Liana ...{06}{07}
Well, I understand.
Please be careful on
the battlefield.{end}

Thank you, {02}!
I won't let you down!{end}

Thank you, I won't
let you down! {02}!{end}

Then let's go to Reitel!{end}

He he he ...
Say goodbye, fools.{06}{07}
Burn to death in this inferno!{end}

So that's what it was!{06}{07}
That must be what
all the oil was for!{end}

We're downwind of the flames!
If we don't move, we're
going to be engulfed in no time!{end}

The flames won't reach
across the river.{06}{07}
We have to hurry and get
to the other side.{end}
