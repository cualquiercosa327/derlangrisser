Your Majesty,
how are you faring?{end}

Excellent, excellent.{06}{07}
Egbert, your treatment
is effective as ever.{06}{07}
Though I must admit, having
that rogue {02} out of
the way is as much a relief.{06}{07}
Gather your fellows, Egbert.
Let us discuss our next move.{end}

Your Majesty, ...{06}{07}
It pains me to say this,
but we could not ...
we did not rout {02}.{06}{07}
Vargas and Imelda fought
and died honourably,
their sacrifices exalt us.{06}{07}
Leon and His Majesty's
Blue Dragon Knights meet
{02} outside our gates.{06}{07}
I do not know
whether he succeeds.{end}

Egbert, I thank you
for your honest appraisal.{06}{07}
Your Kaiser's strength has
failed him, and for that,
he burdened his Empire.{06}{07}
Damn this, Egbert.
Was I so weak?
Was my Empire ...?{end}

Your Majesty ...
Well, that is to say ...{end}

I, I bring distressing news!{end}

What has happened?
Out with it!{end}

General Leon has ...
He has fallen at the
castle gates!{end}

Bernhardt, Bernhardt ...
You're a slippery fellow.{end}

I've located the last twigs
propping up the Imperial shack.
Time to kick you away.{end}

Your death has been
a long time coming.{06}{07}
Don't be too surprised
when I slit your throat.{end}

Ah, the arrogance
and fire of youth ...{06}{07}
Save your words and
face me with armament.{06}{07}
I may not look it now,
but I was once a soldier,
and a good one at that.{06}{07}
You shall learn how worthy
of my generals I am!{end}

Impressive talk.
Let's see if you're honest.{end}

Just like cornered rats ...{end}

Rats or not, we're
of better blood than you.{end}

What's wrong, {02}?
It seems like you're
running out of breath.{06}{07}
What happened to that
burning desire for victory?{end}

Don't be a sore loser.{end}

I'll never give up!{end}

You won't have the
breath to invoke your spells.{end}

Only a little longer ...
and the Kaiser would be mine.{end}

I suppose conceit is
all you have going for you.{end}

The line is drawn.{end}

No, this is nonsense.
How vexing, vexing ...{end}

I don't care
who the hell you are.{06}{07}
Shut your mouth
or I'll take your head!{end}

I'll send you to
the next world, even
if I must follow.{end}

Always the sharp-tongued
jackass, aren't you?{end}

Wh, what!?
I've lost already ...!?
Damn this! Retreat!{end}

Don't worry yourself
about it, Brother.
I'll handle the rest!{end}

Die!{end}

Are you all right, Sonya?{end}

It's over for me ...
I ... I can't do any mor--{end}

{font3}Kill!{end}

{font3}Uuugghhh ...!{end}

{font3}Gaah! Is he human ...!?{end}

{font3}Die now!{end}

Gaaahh ...!{end}

Hmmm, I'm not too rusty.
Decent swordsmanship
for a man out of practise.{end}

His Majesty is a fighter
by nature, and his talent
will not dull easily.{end}

Whatever you say.{end}

That is exactly why
we chose Castle Velzeria!{06}{07}
These iron walls cater to our
strongest formation.
You will not break through!{end}

How kind of you to come here.{06}{07}
Your reward will be Hell.{end}

Bernhardt, your time is up.{end}

The arrogant and young
should hold their tongue.{end}

You bastards' time has come!{end}

I won't die just yet!{end}

Kaiser, your years of rule
have been long and plentiful.
Cherish them as you die.{end}

Kaiser, prepare yourself!{end}

Shit! Little bitch!{end}

Ugh ... Gaahh ...{end}

Your Majesty,
those wounds!
No, no--!{end}

Everyone, ... calm yourselves.
You cannot do ... anything
more for your Kaiser.{06}{07}
Aside from this, I ask ...
How fare the Empire's men?{end}

...{06}{07}
We're doing well,
Your Majesty.{end}

I see, ... that's very good.
All of you, I offer my thanks, ...
for serving the Empire ...{end}

What are you saying ...?
Your Majesty and the Empire,
they, they are the same!{end}

This is my final request, ...
No ... my final order ...{06}{07}
I never regarded you
as a true enemy, {02}.{06}{07}
It's true, you have destroyed
my vision of peace ...
But now ... you have a
chance to create your own ...{06}{07}
Please end the pain ...
and suffering in El Sallia ...{06}{07}
For an old soldier ...
Pl, please end ... it ...{end}

Your Majesty ...!{end}

Your Majesty, ...
are you all right?{end}

With wounds like these ...
I won't live much longer ...{end}

You must be in terrible pain.
Please, rest ... and
don't worry any more.{end}

I will ... do just that ...
Thank you ... Uuggghhh ...{end}

This is my final request, ...
No ... my final order ...{06}{07}
I never regarded you
as a true enemy {02},
so please listen.{end}

I'm listening ...{end}

{02}, ... you may,
may have the power to carry 
out ... my dream ...{06}{07}
Please end the pain ...
and suffering in El Sallia ...{06}{07}
For an old soldier ...
Pl, please end ... it ...{end}

Your Majesty ...!{end}

So ends Bernhardt
and Rayguard.{end}

I founded this nation
with power, and I supplanted
many rulers in the doing.{06}{07}
Though I knew for certain that
there would be hardships,
I was sure it would lead
El Sallia to unbreakable peace.{06}{07}
But others had their own aims,
and I brought nothing but
death to both them and my men.{06}{07}
After all is said and done ...
I must consider
myself to be ... a failure.{end}

I've always seen things
differently, Bernhardt.{06}{07}
All people, even you and
Jessica, had the same hope
to freely live their lives.{06}{07}
My few friends who
refused the yoke of ideology,
they join me here.{06}{07}
We offer the world what
we took for ourselves: liberty
of action and thought.{end}

That may be true for
you, {02} ... but not
every man has your resolve.{06}{07}
Most people have no ...
confidence in themselves and
no confidence in others.{06}{07}
They will serve the first
who asks their loyalty.{06}{07}
They lie, cheat, and steal ...
They cripple the very
society they seek to enjoy.{06}{07}
These, the commoners, ...
will need the firm hand of
a Kaiser and his Empire.{end}

Be at ease.
Even if you don't see it now,
we will bring peace.{end}

I feel much ... 
better hearing that ...
Farewell then, {02}.{end}

Rest in peace, Bernhardt.
I'll do everything I can to
protect this continent.{06}{07}
And I'll defeat anyone
who would threaten
the rights of its people.{end}

This is the last battle.
Everyone, give it your all!{end}

Not bad ...{end}

This castle is a masterful
defensive structure.{06}{07}
Soldiers of ordinary
skill could never penetrate it.{end}

I'll explore the limits
of my power to defeat you!{end}

Even with all my power ...
Even with my studies ...
I could not pro... protect ...{06}{07}
I could not protect
His Majesty ...
or even our Empire.{end}

Egbert, please spare
yourself the criticism.{06}{07}
You were an excellent
counsel to both
your Empire and Kaiser.{06}{07}
Die well and rest in peace.
I shall join you very soon.{end}

Uuggghhh ...{end}

I'll never understand how
you've done this, {02}.{06}{07}
But you will not pass me!{end}

If only those damned ...
Dragon Knights would do
their job ... Grrr ...{end}

Not bad.{end}

It's a concentrated attack!{end}

How did I come this far ...
Only to ... Uugggh ...!{end}

For the glory of the Empire,
I will defeat you!{end}

Gaaaahh ...!
Not yet. It's ... not over--!{end}

If the door won't
open, then I'll break it down.{end}

Aaaaaahhh--!
This sh, shouldn't
have happened ...!{end}

Move to intercept them!{end}

There's no need to rush.
We should exploit this
castle's strategic advantage.{end}

Yes, Sir ...
I understand.{end}

N, no way ...{end}

Not yet--!{end}

This won't end so easily!
The real battle begins now.{end}

Just die!{end}

Uggghh ...
How ... regrettable ...{end}

I couldn't protect ...
His Majesty ...{end}

Gaaaaahh--!{end}

You're pretty good,
but this is the end!{end}

T, too strong ...{06}{07}
Long live the Empire!
Long live the Kaiser!{end}

This is too much ...
Even if it means my life ...
Come at me, {02}!{end}

With my sword,
I'll protect His Majesty.
Let's go, Hein!{end}

You were a fool to think
you could defeat His Majesty!
Now come, Rohga!{end}

How boring.
Only death awaits.{end}

I won't forgive you,
even if you are a woman!{06}{07}
Let's see what you've got,
girl of the Demon Tribe!{end}

Uuuggghhh--!
Must protect ...
His Majesty ...{end}

Farewell, my
worthy opponent ...{end}

Leon, you are more
than a simple soldier.{06}{07}
I know you're eager to
honour our fallen comrades.{06}{07}
But your death
alone serves no purpose!{end}

Our outer guard
has been defeated ...{06}{07}
Your Majesty,
please take care.{06}{07}
They're here far
sooner than I expected.{end}

Has our outer guard
been defeated ...?{06}{07}
This is sooner
than I anticipated ...{end}

The end has come for
both the Descendants
and the Rayguard Empire.{end}

Our dream of a war-free
world will soon be realised.{end}

I don't care.{06}{07}
As a strategist,
I know plans require
continuous revision.{06}{07}
Focus on {02}.
None of the others matter.{end}

The defence can be beneficial.
Let's plan a strike
against each of them!{end}

Quite a confident
fellow, denouncing
us as rats and all.{end}

{02} ...
Hold it ... there ...{06}{07}
The Knights ... will ...
stop you from ...
Reaching ... H, His Majest--{end}

Leon!{end}

What is this?
Those wounds should have ...{end}

Leon, you can barely stand.
Stop being a reckless fool!{end}

Hah hah hah ...
A Knight faces death ...
for his Oath ...{06}{07}
Do you think a ...
few words will stop me?{06}{07}
My life for His Majesty!
We will not be defeated!{end}

Leon ...{end}

My god ...!
Leon, you've done enough.{06}{07}
As your Kaiser I
dismisses you
from your sworn oath.{end}

N, no ... Majesty ...
Please allow a dying Knight ...
th, this last request ...{end}

Leon, I ...
I am deeply moved
by your loyalty.{06}{07}
Now, let's show
these brigands to their hell!{end}

I thank you, ... Sire.{end}

I thought I would be ...
of far more use ...
If I didn't, I would have ...{end}

Cease speaking, Egbert.
I enjoined you
to serve, not otherwise.{06}{07}
And nobody could have
foreseen what has passed.{end}

Your Majesty ...{end}
