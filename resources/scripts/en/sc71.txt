Your Majesty,
how are you faring?{end}

Excellent, excellent.{06}{07}
Egbert, your treatment
is effective as ever.{06}{07}
Though I must admit, having
that rogue {02} out of
the way is as much a relief.{06}{07}
Gather your fellows, Egbert.
Let us discuss our next move.{end}

Your Majesty, ...{06}{07}
It pains me to say this,
but we could not ...
we did not rout {02}.{06}{07}
Vargas and Imelda fought
and died honourably,
their sacrifices exalt us.{06}{07}
Leon and His Majesty's
Blue Dragon Knights meet
{02} outside our gates.{06}{07}
I do not know
whether he succeeds.{end}

Egbert, I thank you
for your honest appraisal.{06}{07}
Your Kaiser's strength has
failed him, and for that,
he burdened his Empire.{06}{07}
Damn this, Egbert.
Was I so weak?
Was my Empire ...?{end}

Your Majesty ...
Well, that is to say ...{end}

I, I bring distressing news!{end}

What has happened?
Out with it!{end}

General Leon has ...
He has fallen at the
castle gates!{end}

Bernhardt, Bernhardt ...
You're a slippery fellow.{end}

I've located the last twigs
propping up the Imperial shack.
Time to kick you away.{end}

Your death has been
a long time coming.{06}{07}
Don't be too surprised
when I slit your throat.{end}

Ah, the arrogance
and fire of youth ...{06}{07}
Save your words and
face me with armament.{06}{07}
I may not look it now,
but I was once a soldier,
and a good one at that.{06}{07}
You shall learn how worthy
of my generals I am!{end}

So, come!
I will fell you!{end}

Heh heh heh ...
I have waited for this.{end}

That voice ...!{end}

Yes, I'm here.{06}{07}
A good vigour, old man.
You'll make this most fun.{end}

B{3a}ser ...{end}

B{3a}ser, withdraw.
We will handle this.{end}

Yeah, do you think we
can't handle a washed up
soldier and his fan club?{end}

Hmmm ...
I had hoped to join in
the merriment ...{06}{07}
But, I suppose I can
give you this gift.{06}{07}
Enjoy the slaughter.
I'll await you in Velzeria.{end}

Now, Bernhardt,
make your peace.{06}{07}
You've few words left.{end}

{02} ...
Hold it ... there ...{06}{07}
The Knights ... will ...
stop you from ...
Reaching ... H, His Majest--{end}

Leon!{end}

What is this?
Those wounds should have ...{end}

What a guy ...{end}

My god ...!
Leon, you've done enough.{06}{07}
As your Kaiser I
dismisses you
from your sworn oath.{end}

N, no ... Majesty ...
Please allow a dying Knight ...
th, this last request ...{end}

Leon, I ...
I am deeply moved
by your loyalty.{06}{07}
Now, let's show
these brigands to their hell!{end}

I thank you, ... Sire.{end}

As you open the treasure chest,
you find a stone inside.{06}{07}

Will you take the stone?{end}

The stone radiates
a mysterious power.{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{06}{07}

You hear the turning of a lock.{end}

As you open the treasure chest,
you find a crimson lance inside.{06}{07}

Will you take the lance?{end}

Obtained Inferno Lance.{06}{07}

You hear the turning of a lock.{end}

The Empire's final
curtain draws.{end}

As if I would be felled
by mere demons!{end}

Im, impossible ...{end}

Victory here ...? Fate must
have been on our side.{06}{07}
Onward to Velzeria
and the end of B{3a}ser!{end}

Gah ...!{end}

Leon, you can
barely walk, and you're
still trying to fight?{06}{07}
You're a loyal knight.
We get it.{06}{07}
Spare us the shame of
killing a cripple.{end}

Those words only ...
strengthen my ... resolve ...{06}{07}
Hah hah hah ...
Maybe I won't share ...
your Hell, {02} ...{end}

Argh! Damn it ...
Just a little bit longer--!{end}

Damn! I was ...
I was useless--!{end}

Ow--!{end}

Sonya, stop fighting
or you'll surely die!
Retreat now!{end}

O, okay ...{end}

{font3}Uuuggghhh!{end}

{font3}Awwwooo!{end}

Why did you come?
Do you not know futility?{06}{07}
You might have lived
in the shadows, at least.{end}

I will never think like that.
Our dreams, our goals ...
I am merely their servant.{end}

All who face the dark
will meet bloody death!{end}

Uuggh--! {02},
I trust you'll handle ...
what's left ...{end}

The ... the pain--!
I can't keep going ...{end}

Liana, don't bother.
Please retreat.{end}

I am sorry,
{02} ...{end}

Ugh ... Gaahh ...{end}

Your Majesty,
those wounds!
No, no--!{end}

Everyone, ... calm yourselves.
You cannot do ... anything
more for your Kaiser.{06}{07}
Aside from this, I ask ...
How fare the Empire's men?{end}

...{06}{07}
We're doing well,
Your Majesty.{end}

I see, ... that's very good.
All of you, I offer my thanks, ...
for serving the Empire ...{end}

What are you saying ...?
Your Majesty and the Empire,
they, they are the same!{end}

This is my final request, ...
No ... my final order ...{06}{07}
Do not waste yourself ...
Do not waste yourself
on avenging my death ...{06}{07}
Knights such as you ...
exist only in legend, Leon.{06}{07}
Please, take ... the
glory you've earned and
start anew ...{06}{07}
That is ... the best
way to serve me.
You have as much ...
gratitude as I can muster.{06}{07}
{02}, ... you may,
may have the power to carry 
out ... my dream ...{06}{07}
Please end the pain ...
and suffering in El Sallia ...{06}{07}
For an old soldier ...
Pl, please end ... it ...{end}

Your Majesty ...!{end}

Your Majesty,
please stand up--!{end}

Everyone, ... calm yourselves.
You cannot do ... anything
more for your Kaiser.{06}{07}
Aside from this, I ask ...
How fare the Empire's men?{end}

...{06}{07}
We're doing well,
your Majesty.{end}

I see, ... that's very good.
All of you, I offer my thanks, ...
for serving the Empire ...{end}

This is my final request, ...
No ... my final order ...{06}{07}
Do not waste yourself ...
Do not waste yourself
on avenging my death ...{06}{07}
You have all ... done enough.
I give you my thanks ...{end}

...{end}

{02}, ... you may,
may have the power to carry 
out ... my dream ...{06}{07}
Please end the pain ...
and suffering in El Sallia ...{06}{07}
For an old soldier ...
Pl, please end ... it ...{end}

Your Majesty ...!{end}

So ends Rayguard.
How sad ...{end}

I founded this nation
with power, and I supplanted
many rulers in the doing.{06}{07}
It is inevitable that the ...
same process should repeat.{06}{07}
Even so, I believed I could ...
bring an era of peace, a time
of rest for El Sallia's people.{06}{07}
That dream is what my men
fought for, and I ...
I am dearly sorry to them.{end}

How misguidedly sentimental.
They knew what they were
in for, and they followed you.{06}{07}
If they didn't, they were
idealistic fools, and deserved
to die all the same.{06}{07}
People are responsible
for themselves, as
well as for their destinies.{06}{07}
They followed just as
I follow: by choice.{end}

That may be true for
you, {02} ... but not
every man has your resolve.{06}{07}
Most people have no ...
confidence in themselves and
no confidence in others.{06}{07}
They will serve the first
who asks their loyalty.{06}{07}
They lie, cheat, and steal ...
They cripple the very
society they seek to enjoy.{06}{07}
These, the commoners, ...
will need the firm hand of
a Kaiser and his Empire.{end}

If that was your
goal, then you should have
gotten to it sooner.{06}{07}
Rest easy, we'll bring
order to this world.{end}

Yes, I know your intent, ...
but remember this ...{06}{07}
Darkness and peace are ...
not compatible ideals.{06}{07}
On your path, misery and
bloodshed will ... be the ...
true rulers of this land.{end}

Ah, now, now ...
I see where
you went wrong.{06}{07}
Your mistake came the
moment you chose to try and
save the weak from their
own dangerous stupidity.{06}{07}
For them, war and
hardship are facts of life.{06}{07}
But, yes, those strong men
who lord over them ...
They just may live your dream.{06}{07}
Observe from Hell.{end}

Next come the Descendants.
After their defeat,
none will oppose us.{end}

Last on our list are those
pathetic Descendants of Light.{end}

Lord B{3a}ser's ideal world
will soon arrive, won't it?{end}

Everyone, this
will be our last battle.{06}{07}
Gather your will and
let us move out!{end}

Darkness will not prevail.
I have worked too long
and hard to see otherwise!{06}{07}
You see, for that purpose,
I ... Well, for once, I shall
spare you a speech.{06}{07}
Of course, this is provided
you kindly succumb.{end}

I sacrificed ... everything ...
to fight the darkness ...{06}{07}
And even with all my power ...
Even with my studies ...
I could not pro... protect ...{06}{07}
I could not protect
His Majesty ...
or even our Empire.{end}

Egbert, please spare
yourself the criticism.{06}{07}
You were an excellent
counsel to Empire and Kaiser.{06}{07}
Die well and rest in peace.
I shall join you very soon.{end}

Grr ... Argh ...{end}

Leon, don't fight any more!
This time you really will die!{end}

That does not matter ...
I have pledged my life
to His Majesty's Empire.{06}{07}
My word is my bond, ...
and I shall not stray from it!{end}

Leon ...{end}

If I puzzle you, ...
I'm not terribly sorry.{06}{07}
In fact ... If my actions grieve
the forces of darkness ...
I will persist wholeheartedly!{end}

Have at you, {02}!{end}

Leon, enough already!
You're a walking corpse.{end}

I'm fighting for the sake ...
of all mankind ...{06}{07}
Don't make me speak.
I will save my energy for
finishing you ...!{end}

Uugghh--!{06}{07}
I will ... I will--!{end}

Farewell, Leon.{end}

Farewell, Leon.
You were formidable.{end}

No ... Now Leon ...
How many people will
die for our purposes?{06}{07}
My enemies, my friends ...
everyone has died for me ...{06}{07}
But I will fight ...
I will fight for
those who remain!{end}

I'm sorry, L{37}na.{end}

P, protect his Majesty ...{end}

Ah!{end}

Let's go.
Attack!{end}

There's no need to rush.
We should exploit this
castle's strategic advantage.{06}{07}
We didn't choose it
for its looks.{end}

Yes, Sir ...
I understand.{end}

Gaahh--! No ...
T, take care of the rest!{end}

Your next
opponent shall be me!{end}

Ugghh--!
N, no good ...{end}

Glory to the Empire!
Glory to our Kaiser!{end}

C, crap!{end}

Aaahhh!{end}

Looks like ... the end ...
Grr ... Uugghh!{end}

My magical power ...
It's fading ...{end}

I thought I would be ...
of far more use ...
If I didn't, I would have ...{end}

Cease speaking, Egbert.
I enjoined you to
serve, not otherwise.{06}{07}
And nobody could have
foreseen what has passed.{end}

Your Majesty ...{end}
