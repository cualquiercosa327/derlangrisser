No matter what, I must tell her.
I promised Vargas ...{end}

I don't feel good about this ...{end}

I am Leon, General of the
Blue Dragon Knights.{06}{07}
Please take me to
see Miss Eliza.{end}

Right away, your Lordship.{end}

Lady Eliza.
Lord Leon has arrived.{end}

Oh ...?
Leon you say?
Please, show him in.{end}

Please enter.{end}

What a lovely little girl!{06}{07}
She resembles you so much!
I'm sure she'll grow up to be
a beautiful young woman.{end}

Oh my, Leon ...
You're just saying that.{end}

I wouldn't presume.{end}

I was angry with him ...{06}{07}
He ... Vargas wanted a son.
He said he would teach him
to be a great soldier.{end}

Vargas would say
something like that ...{end}

How can I tell her ...?{end}

Leon, is something the matter?{end}

Leon ...
You're hiding something.{06}{07}
...!
Vargas! Has something
happened to my husband!?{06}{07}
I know something is wrong!
I've seen that look in
your eye before--you know
I'm a soldier's wife.{end}

General Vargas ...
fell in battle today.{end}

Lady Eliza--!{end}

I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
My ... Vargas ... oh!{06}{07}
I've been prepared
for a day like this ...
How ... how were his
last moments spent?{end}

Your husband died
most honourably.{06}{07}
He fought valiantly to
the end for our nation and
for his daughter's future.{06}{07}
Vargas met his end
as a perfect soldier ...{end}

Is that so ...{end}

I need some time alone ...
Please leave me
be for a little while.{06}{07}
Just a little while ...{end}

I'm sorry.{end}

Oh, ... Vargas ...!
Sob sob ...{end}

I think this is it ... These
are the ruins of Castle Baldea.
What the ...!?{end}

Magnificent!
That must be Langrisser!{end}

Colonel Laird!
The enemy is on our flank.{end}

Damn it!
We need more time!{06}{07}
Until General Leon
returns, don't let them
get near Langrisser!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

The Imperial Army!?
Have they beaten us to it?{end}

Hmmm, ...
I don't think so.{06}{07}
It appears the Imperial Army
hasn't taken Langrisser yet ...{end}

Okay then.
Let's take it before they do!{end}

But, those who aren't
Descendants of Light can't
wield Langrisser, right?{end}

Well, that's what the
ancient texts suggest.{end}

So that leaves Liana,
Cherie, and {02}.{06}{07}
Lady Jessica is a
Descendant of Light too,
but she isn't here.{end}

Really ...
Anyway, hurry.{06}{07}
Let's get to Langrisser
before the Empire does!{end}

Water battalion, cut off
the enemy before they
enter the ruins!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Flying battalion, aim for
their front lines and take
out their cavalry!{end}

Leave it to me!{end}

Ballista, target their
rear forces and lay
waste to their archers!{06}{07}
I will personally ensure
the General has a clear
path to retrieve the sword.{06}{07}
They are strong, so
don't screw this up!{end}

Yes, Colonel!{end}

Is it true that only
General Leon will be able
to claim Langrisser?{end}

Yes ...
The legends say only a
Descendant of Light can.{06}{07}
Anyway, until Leon
arrives, don't let the enemy
near the Holy Blade!{end}

Yes!{end}

But ...
when will Leon come?
We can't spare much time.{end}

Leon went to
notify Lady Eliza of
General Vargas's death.{06}{07}
Explaining such a thing
is a delicate matter,
especially since his wife
has just given birth.{06}{07}
Finding the right words
to say will be difficult.{end}

Is that so ...{end}

Anyway, he'll be here soon.
So until then,
everyone do your best!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

General Leon!{end}

Sorry I'm late.{06}{07}
I was playing with Vargas's
child when I told her what
happened to her husband ...{end}

Really ...{06}{07}
Lady Eliza's hospitality
towards the Generals is famous
even among the troops.{06}{07}
That must have
been heartbreaking ...
However, we're finally on the
verge of achieving our goal.{end}

Wars aren't fought
by the unmourned ...{06}{07}
Because of this, fighting always
brings sadness and pain, even
to the blameless ...{06}{07}
With Langrisser, we'll finally
unify the continent and
establish a world of peace.{end}

We must take Langrisser.
Everyone, cover me!{end}

I'm sorry for being late.
It looks like no one has
taken Langrisser yet.{end}

Jessica!
How are the alliance forces?{end}

They are finally
cooperating, but they took
longer than I expected ...{end}

We'll talk about this later.
For now, worry
about Langrisser.{end}

We'll talk about this later.
For now, worry
about Langrisser.{end}

So this is Langrisser ...
Why does it feel so familiar?{end}

So this is Langrisser.
It looks kind of ordinary ...
Is it really so powerful?{06}{07}
What!?
I can't pull it out.{end}

Well, we've taken Langrisser.
What's next?{end}

Langrisser ...,
the time to awaken has
come once again.{end}

I'm finally here ...
What? How strange, ...
I can't seem to remove it.{end}

So this is the
Legendary Sword ...{06}{07}
What? Why can't I pull it out!?{end}

The Legendary Sword is mine!{06}{07}
Damn ...!?
Son of a bitch, it's stuck!
What the hell?{end}

That's ... Langrisser.
The Might of Elthlead ...{end}

So this is Langrisser.{end}

So this is Langrisser.
Damn, I can't pull it out!{end}

The mission has failed ...
Any more fighting is pointless.
Everyone, retreat!{end}

Wait, Leon!{end}

Farewell!{end}

Damn it, it's over.{end}

This is bad!
If we don't do something,
they will beat us to the sword!{end}

Don't get in my way!
Langrisser is mine!{end}

Charge!{end}

Well then, I'll just have
to try and stop you!{end}

A plank floats in the waves.
On it lies a beautiful flower.{06}{07}

What will you do?{end}

Leave it alone{end}

Take the flower{end}

Break the plank{end}

The plank and flower
sink into the moat.{end}

In the blink of an eye,
the flower withers ...{end}

Inside the flower,
a flower sprite appears.{06}{07}

The flower sprite beams a smile
and disappears into the flower.{end}

AT raised by 3 points!{end}

Damn ...
As long as they have
Langrisser, it's over.{end}

Ouch!
I can't fight like this ...{end}

Argh--!
I have to retreat.{end}

I can't fight.
Sorry, {02} ...{end}

It's useless, I'm sorry ...{end}

Son of a bitch!
What the hell happened!{end}

Have you no respect
for the elderly!?{end}

Aah ...
I can't fight any more.{end}

Langrisser!
Please heed my call!{end}

Impossible!?
How is Leon able to
unsheathe Langrisser?{06}{07}
I looks like we have
a Descendant of Light
among our ranks!{end}

I don't understand, either.
Egbert once told me
I was a Descendant of Light.{06}{07}
If that sorceress over
there saw my weapon,
she might have known
this too ...{end}

That blade ...!?{06}{07}
That sword you carry looks
like the one Dieh{38}rte
used while fighting the demons
hundreds of years ago!{end}

Hmmm ...
How did Egbert
know about this.{end}

And if my memory
is not mistaken ...{06}{07}
The sword you carry was
used by the King of Elthlead,
Sieghart's half-brother,
in ancient times.{end}

Then that means Leon is
a Descendant of Light and
can take Langrisser?{end}

That's quite incredible.
First, I'll defeat you, and
then I'll take Langrisser!{end}

Egbert once said that I
was a Descendant of Light.{06}{07}
Until now I believed
it was just a fairy tale ...
But if Alhazard and Langrisser
really exist, how can I doubt?{end}

Really ...
Then we can't let the
Empire take Langrisser!{end}

I will say the same
thing about you.{06}{07}
Our Empire needs
the Holy Blade.
We will not fail.{end}

Anyway, whoever isn't
moving, get over here!{06}{07}
We can't let them
get Langrisser!{end}

Impossible!
If I'm gone, ... then take
the sword to his majesty.{end}

General Leon!
Please retreat. This way!{end}

Thank you, Laird ...{end}

We are coming to destroy you.
Think you can handle it!?{end}

Laird!
Wipe out the enemy.{end}

Leave it to me!{end}

Damn, not bad ...{end}

Laird!
Retreat and regroup!{end}

I'm sorry, General Leon ...{end}

Why me ...{end}

This is it ...
The final scene ...
The last act ...{06}{07}
It looks like I'm dead ...
Gahh--!{end}

Looks like this is
going to be my last spell ...
Ahhh--!{end}

Forgive me, ... General Leon.{end}

This can't be ...{end}

Damn you fiends!
Of all the places ...{end}

Must ... get the sword ...
for his Majesty--!{end}

We're at a disadvantage
in Laird's absence.{06}{07}
But now the real battle begins!
You won't get your
hands on Langrisser!{end}

Same to you.
You don't really think
you'll win, do you!?{end}

General Leon, the
Blue Dragon Knights share
your hopes for the Empire.{end}

Only the Descendants of
Light can use Langrisser.{06}{07}
Besides myself, there's Cherie,
Liana, and {02}.{end}

I've heard that only
the Descendants of Light
can use Langrisser.{06}{07}
I think that's what the ancient
texts said, so that leaves
{02}, Cherie and I.{end}

I heard that no one except the
Descendants of Light can
unsheathe the Legendary Sword.{06}{07}
Of those present, there's just
me, Cherie and Liana.{end}

No way, it's too dangerous!
Besides, you promised.
We're in this together.{06}{07}
To Rayguard's capital!
We'll take Bernhardt's Palace!{end}

I'm sorry ...
for being so selfish ...{end}

I'll lead a diversionary platoon
against Rayguard to draw them.{06}{07}
No matter what, Alhazard
cannot be allowed to revive.
Now, on to Castle Rayguard!{end}

Damn it!
We were too late.{end}

General Leon,
we must hurry and defeat the
enemy. We still have time!{end}

Stop it!
We don't know of the
sword's power.{06}{07}
Recklessly plunging in
would be foolish.{06}{07}
All units fall back.
Return to the castle to
protect his majesty!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

If we beat them now,
we still might not be able
to take the sword.{06}{07}
We don't know the extent of its
power, and we've already
sustained heavy losses.
We must retreat ...{06}{07}
{02},
I eagerly await our fight!
The next time we meet,
I will slay you!{end}

Without the General
here, fighting is a waste ...
Retreat!{end}

Obtained Masayan Sword.{end}

What the hell?
This isn't Langrisser.
What a strange sword ...{end}

Obtained Langrisser.{end}

It seems there's nobody
left to interfere.{06}{07}
Taking Langrisser will
no longer be difficult.{end}

Is Langrisser the one and
only weapon that can oppose
the Glory of Darkness?{end}

And those that can wield it
are the Descendants of Light.{end}

I'm excited.
Let's begin the attack!{end}

The enemy looks a bit
panicked. It seems they haven't
released Alhazard's power yet.{end}

The enemy looks a bit panicked.
It seems they haven't released
Alhazard's power yet.{end}

There's no other place
I'd rather fight.{end}

If we must fight,
let's do it now!{end}

Excitement at last.{end}

{02} ...{end}

Liana ...
This is it for you.{end}

{02}!
Please bring me with you!
I beg of you!{end}

Oh ... {02},
I ...{end}

Liana, you can relax.
We finally have Langrisser.{06}{07}
We're going to begin our
siege of the Imperial Capital.
Please wait in Kalxath.{end}

No ...!
Please bring me with you!
Please ...{end}

I know ...
I promised I
wouldn't interfere ...{06}{07}
But please,
bring me with you!
I won't slow you down!{06}{07}
If I do, then you
can leave me behind!{end}

Liana, I would never
abandon you.{06}{07}
I see ...
Well, positively do not
exhaust yourself.{end}

Okay, let's relax now.
It's time to tend
to the wounded.{end}

Yes ...{end}

Well, everyone!
Onward to Castle Rayguard!{end}

Let's go!
Onward to Castle Rayguard!{end}

Everyone!
At last, we shall attack
the Empire!{06}{07}
To crush Rayguard's ambition,
we shall do battle--
under the divine protection
of Langrisser!{end}
