The Holy Rod is on an
altar inside this temple.{end}

We'll have to split
up and check each
area individually.{end}

Won't this waste
a lot of time ...?{end}

What?
Somebody is approaching!
Is it the enemy!?{end}

It's here.
Somewhere within these ruins
we'll find the Holy Rod.{end}

According to this
ancient scripture ...{06}{07}
The Holy Rod
should be somewhere
in these ruins.{end}

Hey, Hein ...
Don't you know any spells
that could locate it?{end}

Heh, if only life were
so simple, Lester ...{end}

Is that Rohga
leading the enemy
search party ...?{06}{07}
Yes, it is him!{end}

{02}'s bunch?{06}{07}
Move fast!
We must find it
before they do!{end}

He seems to be after
the rod as well.{06}{07}
Let's hurry!{end}

Everyone, let's go!{06}{07}
We cannot back down,
even for a former ally!{end}

Sorry for being late.{end}

Leon!
Are you all right?{06}{07}
Weren't you injured
in the battle before?{06}{07}
Please, let me
handle this, Sir.{end}

Simple wounds like
these will not keep me
from my duty.{end}

Damn!
We're a little late!{end}

Leon!{end}

We're going to split
up and search for it.{06}{07}
I'm going to
look in the left room
in the back.{06}{07}
We must do whatever
it takes to get the
Holy Rod before they do!{end}

Rohga ...!{06}{07}
I would never imagine
I'd meet you again
in such a situation ...{end}

I was once a
mercenary.{06}{07}
In our world,
friends often
become enemies.{end}

So you're going
to battle for money?{end}

I'm not sure ...{06}{07}
No, for now, the
money isn't important.{06}{07}
Heh heh ...
Maybe I've just wanted
to fight with you.{end}

All right!
The operation is complete!
Withdraw!{end}

Damn, if we had a
little more time ...{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
I'm not much of a talker.
For me, everything I know,
everything I feel, I learn
through my sword.{06}{07}
Ever since I met you,
I've wanted to do battle
with you just once!{06}{07}
Show me what
kind of a man you are!{end}

Rohga ...
I don't want this!{end}

{02} ...{06}{07}
The time for such
words is long past.{06}{07}
I buried our former
allegience in that
cemetery with Ikreuz!{06}{07}
Come on, fight me,
and don't hold back!{end}

Gah ...
Is this the end
for me ...?{end}

It seems I'm not as
strong as I thought ...{end}

Ouch!{06}{07}
How dare you do
such things to a
polite young lady!{end}

Gah--
I've failed ...{end}

Shit ...!
You did better
than I thought!{end}

Aahhh!
This is my limit ...
I can't do any more ...{end}

Aaah--!
I blew it ...{end}

I'm sorry ...
I'll retreat ...{end}

Argh, I can't
take this!{end}

{02}!{06}{07}
I will not let you, or
any enemy of the Empire,
take the Holy Rod!{end}

Move!
You're in the way!{end}

I will not be defeated!{06}{07}
I'm not the sort
who would fall from
a few scratches!{end}

My wound still
hasn't healed ...{06}{07}
{02},
I will pay you
back for this!{end}

I won't tolerate failure!
Find the Rod, now!{end}

It's nothing personal,
but we're enemies now.
I'm going to kill you.{end}

Tsk, tsk!
You annoying rats!{end}

Such strength ...
To imagine there are fighters
even more powerful than I ...{06}{07}
I'm proud to have battled
with and against a warrior
as great as you, {02}.{end}

Rohga ...{end}

Farewell ...!{06}{07}
May we meet again
in the underworld!{end}

Damn ...
You're pretty good!{end}

You, search
over there!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

I will
search the left.{end}

Stay there
and be quiet!{end}

This isn't
happening ...{end}

You, go to the right!{end}

Certainly.{end}

I will search
the right room!{end}

Ughh ...
I cannot die now ...{end}

We're going to escape!
Move the enemies' cavalry!{end}

Yes, Sir!
I will secure a path
for the retreat.{end}

I have your word!{end}

Gahh ...{end}

Ughh ...
my strength ... is ...
leaving me ...{end}

We shall aid Rohga!
Charge!{end}

I am sorry,
my beloved ...{06}{07}
I don't think I'll
survive this time ...{end}

Ha ha ha ...
En garde!{end}

You are
strong indeed ...{end}

Aahh--!
I can't ...{end}

At last, the time for
me to meet my departed
friends has come ...{06}{07}
Gah--arrgghh ...!{end}

Gah--!{end}

Finally, it's over ...{end}

Well, let's find
the Holy Rod.{end}

I've found it!
This is the Holy Rod!{end}

Obtained Holy Rod.{end}

Finally, it's over ...{end}

Well, let's find
the Holy Rod.{end}

I've found it!
This is the Holy Rod!{end}

Obtained Holy Rod.{end}

There it is!{end}

Oh! I found it!{end}

It's here!{end}

I've discovered it!{end}

Heh heh.
I've found it!{end}

Here it is!{end}

There it is.
It's right here!{end}

I found it here!{end}

Found it!{end}

Here it is!{end}

I have discovered it!{end}

It's not here ...{end}

Tsk, can't find it.{end}

It doesn't look
like it's here.{end}

It's not here ...{end}

Damn, not here.{end}

It's not over here.{end}

I can't find it.{end}

Hmmm,
seems like it's
not here.{end}

Damn!
It's not here.
Search the other rooms!{end}

There's nothing here!{end}

Not here ...{end}

Hurry!
We can't let them leave
with the Holy Rod!{end}

You won't take
the Holy Rod!{end}

All right, listen
up, everybody!{06}{07}
Gather around the
temple, and prepare for
the enemies attack!{end}

Men, battle stations!{06}{07}
Gather at the temple entrance.
We must repel the enemy.{end}

I have taken
the Holy Rod!{end}

I found the Holy Rod!{end}

Obtained Holy Rod.{end}

All right, let's go outside!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

I have the Holy Rod.{06}{07}
I'm heading for the
exit, so cover me!{end}

Obtained Holy Rod.{end}

All right, let's
hurry and escape!{06}{07}
Have the others back me up!{end}

Damn! They beat us ...
Don't let them get away!{06}{07}
Take back the rod!{end}

We did it!
Now we can stand
against Alhazard!{end}

...{end}

Big sister ...{end}

Fighting Leon is
painful for you, isn't it?{end}

N, no ...
It's all right ...{06}{07}
Alhazard must be sealed.
Even if we have
to do things like this ...{end}

We will end this war.{06}{07}
I just hope we may see
a day when we aren't divided
as enemies and allies ...{end}

Yeah.
But first we must release
Langrisser's seal.{end}

At last, we can release
Langrisser's seal ...{end}

Let's hurry with the
incantations, sister!{end}

Yeah!{end}

It seems as
though you've retrieved
the Holy Rod.{end}

Liana!{end}

While we wait,
Alhazard is
gaining strength.{06}{07}
We must hurry up
and release Langrisser!{end}

At last, we can release
Langrisser's seal ...{end}

Let's hurry with the
incantations, sister!{end}

Yeah!{end}

Unbind the Light that
rests within me ...{end}

Empower this sword
with the power of Light
that rests within me ...{end}

Charge the Holy Rod
with light ...{end}

Now to bring forth the
sword's true power!{end}

What a magnificent glow ...{end}

Langrisser's hidden
power has been released!{end}

With Langrisser revived, we
can show B{3a}ser the true power
of the Descendants of Light!{end}

It will only get tougher
from here on out.{06}{07}
However, if we work
and act as one, we can
overcome any difficulty.{06}{07}
If we all have faith in
ourselves, we can succeed.{06}{07}
If we believe in hope,
the Sword of Light will
shine even brighter.{end}

I'll ... give it my all!{end}

All right!
I'm going to give it
everything I've got, too!{end}

We've made it this far ...{06}{07}
We can do it!{end}

Let's work together!{end}

As long as I continue to
have strength, I'll fight!{end}

I'm up for
the challenge!{end}

You can count on
me till the end!{end}

You can count on
me till the end!{end}

This is as much
as I can do ...{06}{07}
However, please do not forget
that my prayers are
with the Sword of Light.{end}

Let's go!
We shall fight
as one!{end}

Everyone ...{end}

All right, let's do it!
To Castle Velzeria!{end}

Damn!
Oh well, time
to retreat!{end}

In a vacant spot of earth
there is a glittering garb.{06}{07}

Will you take it?{end}

Obtained Wizard's Robe.{end}
