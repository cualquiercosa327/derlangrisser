Yes, the
Holy Rod is ours ...{06}{07}
We will return to
His Majesty at once.{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Stop there!
You won't take it!{end}

Meddling wizard ...{end}

We can't waste any time.
They're injured, but
hit them hard and fast.{end}

I can only dream of
succeeding here ...{end}

Aaahh ...!{end}

J, Jessica!{06}{07}
Colonel Laird, the
sorceress is escaping!{end}

That crafty witch is
really something else ...{end}

Colonel Laird,
are you all right?{end}

Don't worry about it.
Move out!{end}

I have the Holy Rod!{end}

Obtained Holy Rod.{end}

Excellent work, Laird.
Now we can
proceed with the ritual.{end}

All right, maidens.
Please reveal
Langrisser's true form.{end}

Oh, sword of Lushiris ...
sword of virtue ...{06}{07}
We have sought your
aid since times untold!{end}

We shall release
the light within you ...{end}

I touch this blade
to the sleeping light ...{end}

Holy Rod, offer yourself ...{06}{07}
And return this sword's
true strength!{end}

What an incredible glow ...{end}

Have we unleashed
its hidden power?{end}

Hmmm, what fortune.{06}{07}
Our chances of defeating
Alhazard have just increased.{end}

All right, we go!
We'll destroy B{3a}ser!{end}

Is B{3a}ser still
around here?{end}

He should be in the
forbidden land, Velzeria.{06}{07}
There's an ancient
legend about the darkness'
imprisonment there.{06}{07}
We should take
the fight to him rather
than wait around.{end}

It seems you humans
are quite ignorant.{end}

Hmmm, ...
We're surrounded ...{end}

I didn't even notice!{end}

You won't enter
the castle
through these gates!{end}

Sonya!{end}

Rohga ...{end}

{02}, please give me
one last chance.
I'll persuade her this time.{06}{07}
Let me speak with Sonya.{end}

All right.{06}{07}
Everyone, cover Rohga
until he reaches her.{end}

Leave it to me, Rohga.
I'll defend you.{end}

Guys, I owe you one.{end}

Master B{3a}ser is still napping.
We'll have to stop them alone!{end}

{font3}For an era of evil!{end}

{font3}For Master B{3a}ser!{end}

...{end}

Sonya ...
Why do you continue
to resent humans?{06}{07}
You're allowing the
same tragedies to
repeat themselves.{end}

...{end}

Stop tormenting me!
B{3a}ser is so much
nicer than my brother!{end}

Don't you remember
how it was, Sonya?
Can't we be family again?{end}

Is this it ...{end}

I'm sorry everyone,
but I can't stand this ...{end}

If you follow the
darkness, we will end
you along with it!{end}

You humans will never change.
You only think of yourselves!{06}{07}
I'll always hate you,
even my brother!{end}

No ...
S, Sonya ... Please!{end}

Rohga, don't be careless!
You're losing blood.{end}

But if we retreat now ...{end}

Brother, it's futile ...
I can't go back ...{06}{07}
I've stained my hands
too much to go back to my
brother's side ...{end}

How could ...{end}

Master Rohga!{end}

I'm okay.
I just lost concentration.{06}{07}
I need time to recover.{end}

Yes ...{end}

I was unprepared ...
Forgive me, {02}.
It's up to you now!{end}

{font3}Ugghh!
{font3}How dare you!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Bastard, I'll return
{font3}the favour one day!{end}

What a mistake ...
Grr--! I'll remember this!{end}

How could I be
beaten by monsters ...{end}

I don't want to see
my brother's face any more!
Get out of here!{end}

Brother, please!
Don't make me suffer.{end}

Damn!{end}

Ugh ...
So those are my brother's
trusted companions ...{end}

Sonya!
Get a hold of yourself, Sonya!{end}

Sorry, brother ...
I'm finished ...{06}{07}
But I don't feel lonely ..., 
because I get to
lay in your arms ...{end}

Ahh ... always ...
together, like old times ...{06}{07}
...{end}

S, Sonya!{06}{07}
Nooooooooooo!{end}

You bastards ...
If Sonya wasn't
perverted by you scum ...!{06}{07}
B{3a}ser, when we meet,
I'll make you beg for Hell!{end}

Hold on, Sonya!{end}

Why ...?
I'm your enemy.{end}

No, you're my
kid sister.{06}{07}
Just this once, 
please remember that!{end}

Aahh, so warm.
I'll never forget the kindness
you've shown me.{06}{07}
If I'd never met B{3a}ser ...
No, now it's too late.{end}

Tell my brother ...
Sonya left behind her hatred
and accepted humans, and ...{06}{07}
I'm grateful he came all
the way here to find me.{end}

Sonya, hang on, Sonya!{end}

If only she saw things
as they really were.
Without confusion ...{06}{07}
B{3a}ser, your end is coming.
I will defeat you!{end}

...{end}

How emotional.{06}{07}
I didn't know she
had so little conviction.{end}

Please, don't say that.{06}{07}
She didn't lay anything on
her parents' deaths ...
She accepted responsibility.{end}

I'll ... I'll give
you a moment to yourself.{06}{07}
I'll go on ahead.{end}

Wait up!
I'm going too!{end}

...{end}

You are a strong man.
Use this sadness and
remember what we fight for.{06}{07}
I'll be waiting for
you to catch up.{end}

R, Rohga ...
You know ...{end}

...{06}{07}
Against B{3a}ser, I'm at
your side, Rohga.{end}

I couldn't save you ...{06}{07}
Ever since you left,
I've thought about it.
And in the end ...{06}{07}
I failed you and I failed us.
I, I've lost my purpose.{06}{07}
But ...{06}{07}
God damn it!
There's war to fight, and
I have to keep going!{end}

Even when I was on
the frozen fields of Kadath!{end}

Or bound to the scorching
rocks of Seviglia!{end}

I stared down death things
no man should ever see.{end}

I survived again and again,
hoping to find you.
To find our lost happiness.{end}

Farewell ...
We'll meet again,
Sonya ...{end}

{font3}Ahh, the amazing
{font3}Langrisser. Powerful ...{end}

{font3}When B{3a}ser's
{font3}recovered, ... you will ...{end}

{font3}Gaaahhh--!{end}

{font3}Ooohh--!{end}

{font3}Ugh!{end}

{font3}Uugghhh--!{end}

{font3}Argh ...{end}

{font3}Ugh ...{end}

{font3}You humans
{font3}would dare defy
{font3}us monsters!?{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}You'll pay for that
{font3}foolish notion
{font3}with your lives!{end}

{font3}You damn humans ...{end}

{font3}Mmmmm, delicious
{font3}looking humans.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Come sleep
{font3}in my arms.{end}

{font3}Gaahhh!
{font3}H, how dare ...{end}

{font3}How could this ...!?
{font3}How can I, the Prince
{font3}of the Undead, die ...{end}

{font3}Sonya's been killed!
{font3}Run, withdraw quickly!{end}

{font3}Sonya betrayed us.
{font3}Go tell B{3a}ser.{end}

Rohga ...
We should give up on Sonya.{06}{07}
Nothing you've said
has made a difference.{06}{07}
Persuading her
is impossible.{end}

You may be right ...{06}{07}
But I'll try if there's
the slightest chance
she'll turn around.{06}{07}
When my last effort fails ...
I will ... finish things.{end}

I see.
Well, we will help
however we can.{end}

Thanks ...
I'm in your debt.{end}

Sonya!
I don't want to lose you!
Please, listen to me!{end}

I don't know
how Rohga's going to
live without her ...{end}

Sonya!{end}

...{end}

Listen up, Sonya!{06}{07}
You've been thinking
only of those
horrible memories.{06}{07}
If that were all of human
nature, I'd understand you.
I might even agree!{06}{07}
But have you forgotten our
guardian, Ikreuz? Don't you
remember how he raised us?{end}

Father Ikreuz ...{end}

Yes, remember
Ikreuz's kindness.{06}{07}
That warm feeling
of having Ikreuz care
for us like a father!{end}

...{06}{07}
In that chilly forest,
we were freezing.{06}{07}
A soft, welcoming hand
reached out to us.
It felt like father was there.{end}

If Ikreuz never found us,
I'd probably detest
humans as much as you do.{06}{07}
Humans are weak.
They hurt each other and
don't know or care.{06}{07}
But despite their flaws,
they try hard, Sonya ...{end}

...{06}{07}
This era, this war,
stole our parents from us.
I see that now ...{end}

Yes, it has to end.{06}{07}
We must bring peace,
so that others
won't suffer as we did ...{06}{07}
Hate breeds bloodshed,
and bastards like B{3a}ser
take advantage of it!{06}{07}
Do you understand, Sonya?{end}

Brother ...{06}{07}
If this war ends,
can humans and demons
live in peace?{end}

Yes, they certainly can.
I've lived a long time
without trusting others.{06}{07}
But in {02} and Hein,
I've made some strong friends
and comrades.{06}{07}
With a trusting heart,
you can overcome
any misunderstanding.{end}

Sonya, please join us.
Together we can
build a better world.{end}

Yes, together, we'll bring
hope and prosperity
back to humans and demons.{end}

So kind ...
It's nice having friends.{06}{07}
I, I wonder if I
could get used to this ...{end}

Without a doubt!
We promise you!{end}

You'll learn to love it.
It's true!{end}

Thank you, everyone!{end}

I'm going to start over
and build a new life!{end}

Sonya joins the entourage!{end}

Hmph ...
B{3a}ser's the last detail.{end}

All right!
B{3a}ser's the only one left!{end}

B{3a}ser's inside this castle.{end}

Let's strike down
B{3a}ser at once!{end}

There's no point any more!
Listen to me, Sonya!{06}{07}
Why must we fight?{end}

Because you're a human,
and I'm half-demon!{end}

When are you going to
stop sulking about that!?{06}{07}
Stop dwelling on
things and just listen
to me, Sonya!{end}

You're always like that ...{06}{07}
You think you know me,
but you don't understand.{06}{07}
I hate you!
I really hate you!{06}{07}
If you were worried
about me, why didn't you
come back sooner!{06}{07}
My hands are so bloody ...,
there's no way I could go back.{end}

...{end}

No, the only thing
I know is fighting.{06}{07}
Even if I'm defeated,
I chose this life and
I accept everything ...!{end}

Fuck! Why ...?{06}{07}
Why did it have
to come to this?{end}

Brother, take up
your sword!{06}{07}
You'll fight me, or
I'll kill you.
It's your choice!{end}

Why, Sonya?
What did I ever
do wrong?{end}

A red medicine bottle
is hanging from the wall.
Will you drink it?{end}

AT raised by 1 point!{06}{07}
The sound of a smashing
bottle elsewhere is heard.{end}

A yellow medicine bottle
is hanging from the wall.
Will you drink it?{end}

MP raised by 2 points!{06}{07}
The sound of a smashing
bottle elsewhere is heard.{end}
