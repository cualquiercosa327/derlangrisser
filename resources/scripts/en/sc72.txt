What a nice ride ...
Flying really lifts the soul.{end}

You sure sound
chipper, Princess ...{end}

Ah, how couldn't I?
You've never flown so ...
Wait, would you like to try?{end}

...{06}{07}
I like my feet on the ground,
or actually, on a boat.{06}{07}
I'll just ride the waves,
if you don't mind.{end}

Ahhh, Lester, you're
scared of heights?{06}{07}
That bridge must
have been an ordeal.{end}

Now that you mention it,
that job didn't jibe with me.{06}{07}
Now you get why I was Keith's
first choice for it, right?{06}{07}
He knew I don't
like dangling in the air ...{end}

But you did it anyway ...{06}{07}
Your friendship
with Keith must have
been very strong.{06}{07}
He was right to
put his faith in you.{end}

...{06}{07}
Keith, I'll see to
your princess, and I'll
protect her business.
Rest easy, Sir Knight.{end}

Lady Jessica, I wonder
if we should just be waiting.{06}{07}
Why aren't we
observing {02}'s battle
with Rayguard?{end}

Sir Aaron, no matter
who wins, the victor will
strike us here.{06}{07}
Until that time, we
must put our resources to
an adequate defence.{end}

I wonder who will come, ...
the Empire or {02} ...?{end}

Indeed ...
On top of that, I worry
about Liana ...{end}

Oh, there's no
need for concern.{end}

As you can see,
I'm doing quite well!{end}

Liana! You're ...
What's wrong?{end}

No ...!
I've seen that look before ...
She is under B{3a}ser's control.{end}

You say he's using her?
God damn it ...!{end}

What are you saying?
She is not herself?{end}

That's right ...
Right now, she is nought
but B{3a}ser's puppet.{06}{07}
She'll dispose
of his enemies ... you.{end}

Th, that's horrible!
I won't forgive him for that!{end}

Don't get too far
ahead of yourselves.{06}{07}
Before you go dreaming
of revenge, you've got quite
a mess to contend with.{06}{07}
In fact, the only thing you
should be thinking about ...
is the best way to die!{end}

This is your end!
We're through holding back
on people like you!{end}

Don't lower your
guard for even a second!{end}

They have made
it to the interior!{end}

If they defeated the Empire, ...
they're not to be trifled with.{end}

I shouldn't have ...
let down my guard.{end}

It's not over yet!
I'll stop you all somehow!{end}

I'm still alive and
kicking, Lady Jessica!{end}

We have finally
breached the interior.{06}{07}
Don't break formation.
Stay sharp, everyone!{end}

Let's pull together.
Remember, we're fighting for
everyone's right to live!{06}{07}
The darkness will take
that away, all of it!{end}

Leave it to us!{end}

I know!{end}

So, after everything ...
It's come down to me.{end}

{02}, do you truly
think B{3a}ser's legions are
best for this world?{end}

I don't know ...
and I'm not sure I care.{06}{07}
The important thing
is this: we will
not pander to weakness.{end}

But don't you understand ...
The rule of darkness
will make everyone suffer ...!{end}

You say this as if you and the
Empire have done particularly
well in that regard.{06}{07}
So much blood on this
little continent, and all
because of your pride.{06}{07}
Maybe darkness deserves a try.
Wouldn't you agree?{end}

I see your morals
are bankrupt.{06}{07}
As you wish,
I will appeal to strength.{06}{07}
{font4}Fram Kadath o Yeless,
{font4}Le Hlutor Scelde,
{font4}Lushiris, Beorg Ure!{end}

N, no ...!?
This is ... impossible ...!{end}

Lushiris herself?
Summoned here ...!?{end}

The goddess of light!
How, how incredible ...!{end}

Lushiris ...
I ... We thank you.{end}

I've been watching
everything from above.
You needn't explain.{end}

{02}, you think light
doesn't exist in this world, and
that you will go unpunished.{06}{07}
Please, approach
me with all the strength
you possess.{end}

A voice calls
from somewhere far off.{06}{07}

"Humans have not set
foot on my island for aeons ..."{06}{07}

"If you require my aid,
then just call out my name."{end}

Which name will you call?{end}

Lushiris{end}

Chaos{end}

Odin{end}

"It seems as though we old
ones have been forgotten ..."{end}

"It seems as though we old
ones have been forgotten ..."{end}

"Yes, my name is Odin.
I'll lend you my strength ..."{06}{07}

Obtained Odin's Buckler.{end}

You can see some sharp metal 
at the bottom of the crater.{06}{07}
Do you take it?{end}

Obtained Inferno Lance.{end}

I don't care who you are.
I won't lose here.{end}

You sound just
a tad overconfident.{end}

Well, aren't you ready?
Let us see
what true strength is!{end}

Finally, we'll settle things.
But never forget,
you can still surrender.{end}

Sorry, I don't like the way
things are going around here.
I'm afraid I'll decline.{end}

Then die like a fool.{end}

Why ...!?
If only I could ...
fight a little longer ...{end}

Aaaarrggghh!
It's, it's over for me!{end}

Damn it all ...
My old wounds ...{end}

Enough ...
That's it!{end}

{font3}Ooooohhh--!{end}

{font3}Aaaahh--!{end}

Forgive me, B{3a}ser, for
withdrawing at such a time.{end}

Wh, what ... No ...
Who is ... I, what ...?
My head! My head--!{end}

Liana, what's going on?{end}

Aahhh ... I'm--all right now.
Just concentrate
on our victory, {02}.{end}

Sorry, {02}.{06}{07}
You need a better sparring
partner than the Empire
if you aim to defeat
the legendary Descendants.{end}

If you're going to attack, do it!
You won't come within
six paces of Lady Jessica.{end}

Forgive me ...
M, my sword technique ...
is ... a bit rusty ...{06}{07}
If I could have fought them ...
in my prime, oh how ...{end}

Aaron ...!
Snap out of it, Aaron!{end}

I'm sorry, I'm ...
I just can't any longer ...{end}

All right, now I'm pissed!
You'll pay, {02}!{end}

Gaahhh!{end}

Just die!{end}

I can still ... fight ...{end}

Ah, this blue sky can't
be dyed with evil ...{end}

Gaaahhh--!{end}

Guys, keep it up!
We must protect Jessica!{end}

I'll take care of her.
Don't worry, just fight with
all your heart!{end}

Thanks, Aaron!{end}

Oh, no!
No, ... Cherie!{end}

I, I guess I didn't ...
expect to win against you.{06}{07}
{02}, when we
are reborn, I hope we can ...
lead simpler lives ...{end}

Cherie, I'm so sorry.
You didn't deserve ... {end}

Don't be sad ...{06}{07}
I, I don't have any regrets ...
I ... fought for peace ...
to ... the bitterest end ...{end}

Princess, I thought of you
as a daughter, and even so ...
my strength wasn't ...{06}{07}
{02}, you have
lived long enough!
Prepare for vengeance.{end}

Well then, I suppose
I'll move to counter them.{end}

Be careful, Lester.{end}

Right!{end}

Damn it ...!
I was careless, wasn't I?{06}{07}
Sorry, Keith. 
Looks like I can't protect
Cherie any more ...{end}

No, ... Lester!
I can't lose you too!{end}

Shit ... Shit!
I don't care what happens
to me, but Jessica ... must live!{06}{07}
Fuck it ... all ...!
What a cruel world ...{end}

Lester ...
You did very well.
Rest in peace.{end}

All cavalry, attack!{end}

Turn them
from the castle!{end}

M, my duty hasn't been ...{end}

I lived a full life.
I have no regrets ...{end}

This is it, isn't it ...?{end}

So, let me witness
your so-called power!{end}

The power of darkness
is the power of suffering.
They are inseparable.{end}

I have not seen such
humans on this plane for
many ages ...{06}{07}
If your leadership brings
peace and prosperity,
that is well and good.{06}{07}
But if your rule
becomes one of catastrophe,
then I shall return.{06}{07}
And no human
will need summon me ...{end}

What do you
mean by that, Lushiris?{end}

People often seek
more power than
what is good for them.{06}{07}
Right now, you are
standing on the
precipice of insanity.{06}{07}
And this world will be
whatever you choose to make
of it, {02}, for
better or for worse.{06}{07}
I do not typically interfere
in human concerns, but I may
make an exception for you.{06}{07}
Though my corporeal body
will fade, I will watch
from above, ... as I ever have.{end}

Ledin, King of Baldea.
I bid you welcome.{end}

"Ledin" alone is fine.
It has been ages since last
we met, Jessica.{end}

Naturally, he
isn't the true prince
you once served.{06}{07}
He is but shadows and dust
conjured from my
infinite memory of this world.{06}{07}
I think, however, you shall
find my memory is quite good.{end}

Lushiris, though I
appreciate being back ...{06}{07}
Could you enlighten
me as to why I
have been called back?{end}

I wish to enlist
your aid in this battle.{06}{07}
Here, the fate of
the Descendants of Light
will be decided.{06}{07}
Sadly, your descendant,
{02}, stands against
them -- with the darkness.{end}

I see ...{end}

L, Lushiris ...
I beg your pardon ...{end}

It's all right.
Now, please rest comfortably.{end}

I apologise ...{end}

I would expect nothing
less from a man of my blood.
I cannot win here.{06}{07}
I will return to
the eternal slumber.
Until next time ...{end}

N, not yet ...
The Descendants of Light
cannot ... they cannot ...{06}{07}
Oh shining goddess,
hear my plea, and
appear before us ...{06}{07}
{font4}Fram Kadath o Yeless,
{font4}Le Hlutor Scelde,
{font4}Lushiris, Beorg Ure!{end}

L, Lushiris ...!?{end}

I have been watching over
your battle from above.{06}{07}
Please, leave the
rest in my hands.{end}

We could not ...
complete the ordained duty of
the Descendants of Light ...{06}{07}
Please, forgive us ...{end}

Slumbering hero who
lies within my memory, I call
upon your might ...!{06}{07}
{font4}Wreccan Fram Thin Slaepe,
{font4}Hatte The Lifde, Ledin!{end}

Did you call
for me, Lushiris?{end}

Th, that's it ...
I can't fight any more ...{end}

Jessica, you worked very hard.
I entreat you, please rest now.{end}

Lushiris ... I beg you ...
Please save this world ...{end}

Ugh, you ...
you have become
this powerful ...{end}

It's over ...
Everything is over ...{end}

Good job, {02}.{end}

Holy shit ... Incredible!
You've even killed a deity!{end}

Now, things will be
different in this world.{end}

Hee hee!
We've even defeated the
goddess of light!{06}{07}
Lord B{3a}ser shall
be very, very pleased!{end}

That's right, my sister.
He should free us from our
duties as Sealing Maidens.{end}

No enemies remain
to oppose us.{06}{07}
We need to take this kingdom
as quickly as possible,
and then unite the others.{06}{07}
That is our objective.
We cannot rest.{end}

Leave it to me!{end}

{02}, I will do anything
for you and Master B{3a}ser.{end}

First, we will return to B{3a}ser.
Then, we will take
the final steps to our goal.{end}

Your death means an end
to the Descendants of Light.{end}

You must come
to your senses, Liana!{end}

Don't make me laugh!{06}{07}
You think words
can shake her loyalty
to Master B{3a}ser?{end}
