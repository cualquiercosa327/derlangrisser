Princess!{end}

Ahh, that was so exciting!
Just what I needed!{end}

Y, you sneaked out
of the castle again?{06}{07}
If you have time to play,
you have time to
learn some basic tactics!{06}{07}
You're this country's ...
You're Kalxath's princess!{end}

Ooohhh, but the weather ...
The weather was fantastic!
It's beautiful outside!{06}{07}
Honestly, how can I
stay cooped up in here?{end}

Princess, really!{end}

Hey, you two at it again?
Why don't you marry
each other, already.{end}

Look, it's Lester,
just who I want to see!{end}

Lester, Keith lately ...
He's just so uptight!
Tactics this, strategy that ...{end}

Huh?{end}

Where did he go?
Keith? Keith!{end}

Hey, Lester, where
do you think Keith ...{end}

What, Lester too ...?{06}{07}
Those two, really!
Where did they run off ...?{end}

Zzz ... Zzz ...{end}

Cherie ...?{end}

Zzz ... Zzz ...{end}

Aah! I, I'm awake, I'm awake!
What can I help you with?{end}

What's wrong?{end}

I'm just a little tired.
I, I was having a dream ...
It's nothing ...{end}

Are you sure
you're okay?{06}{07}
A decisive battle is starting,
and it's against {02} ... {06}{07}
If you don't want
to fight him, now is the
time to leave.{end}

I, I'll be fine!
Really, I'm just a
bit fatigued.{06}{07}
{02}, ... you said ...?{end}

Princess Cherie, Lady Jessica!
The Imperial Army has arrived!{end}

What's this ...?
A fortress?{end}

This hasn't been here long.{06}{07}
When in the world did
they put all this together?{end}

The construction's solid.
It'll be tough to breach.{end}

So they made it this
far that quickly ...{end}

So ... This means ...
Lester, Lester is gone too ...{end}

After sharing in our promise,
he sighed his last breath.{06}{07}
No matter what occurs,
we vowed to end the darkness.
He died with that faith.{end}

He was concerned for you,
Jessica, until the very end.{06}{07}
If there's any way at all,
I'd rather not fight you.
Please surrender, for our sake.{end}

Lester, I'm so sorry ...{end}

Lady Jessica ...
No, I'll address you
as I did, as Master.{06}{07}
Master, you are a skilled
magician, but you lack the
Empire's strength in battle.{06}{07}
Your victory grows more
improbable with each day.
Please, surrender.{end}

...{06}{07}
We will not give up.{06}{07}
Our friends gave their
lives to see a new dawn, to
see what we promised.{06}{07}
And we will honour that,
no matter what you say!{end}

Even if I'm alone, I'll fight
to the very end.
That's my answer, Egbert.{end}

Is that so ...?
Then this battle, sadly,
was inevitable.{06}{07}
For a grand and unified
continent, all forces advance!
Take no prisoners.{end}

Are we too late!?{end}

Who are you and
why are you here?{end}

We are the people of Salrath!{06}{07}
We've come to take
vengeance for Lord Loren
and Scott's honour!{end}

Yes!
Allow us to take revenge!{end}

Lord Loren ...
It is regrettable to have lost
such a kind-hearted man.{end}

We're carrying a heavy
burden on our shoulders.{end}

Until we avenge our lord,
we won't return to Salrath.{end}

Our opponents are
the Empire's most elite.
Be careful.{end}

Almost time ...
Everyone, counterattack!{end}

Aaaahhhh!
Now, let's take them
out with one blow!{end}

Please don't do
anything reckless!{end}

Air and sea units,
don't go it alone. Coordinate
with the fortress guards!{06}{07}
Together, you can crush
the opposition! Don't
lose this opportunity.{end}

Leave it to me!{end}

No problem!{end}

Don't you understand, Master?
You have no chance here.{06}{07}
Lay down your weapons
and bring the peace
we've both strove for.{end}

For the Descendants of Light,
things are not so simple.{06}{07}
Our divine duty is protecting
Langrisser, and we
will honour that charge.{end}

Heh heh heh ... 
How interesting.{06}{07}
Your refusal, at least,
brings me a small pleasure.{06}{07}
I've always dreamt of a
wizard's duel with you ...{06}{07}
And I've learnt much since
your tutelage, Master Jessica,
as I'll be pleased to show!{end}

A voice calls
from somewhere far off.{06}{07}

"Humans have not set
foot on my island for aeons ..."{06}{07}

"If you require my aid,
then just call out my name."{06}{07}

What name will you call?{end}

Lushiris{end}

Chaos{end}

Odin{end}

"It seems as though we old
ones have been forgotten ..."{end}

"It seems as though we old
ones have been forgotten ..."{end}

"Yes, my name is Odin.
I'll lend you my strength ..."{end}

Obtained Odin's Buckler.{end}

You can see some sharp metal 
at the bottom of the crater.{06}{07}
Do you take it?{end}

Obtained Inferno Lance.{end}

Cherie, stop this.
I don't want to kill you!{end}

What the hell are
you suggesting?
That I just give up?{06}{07}
Keith, Aaron, Kalxath's men ...
You want me to spit
on their deaths!? I won't!{06}{07}
Only a selfish coward
would think like you!{end}

Forgive me, Lester.
I couldn't keep my promise ...{end}

Is this the end ...?{end}

Death is inevitable
on the battlefield ...{06}{07}
If this was only about me,
I'm glad to have
died by your hands ...{06}{07}
Goodbye,
{02} ...{end}

Damn, I have to retreat!
{02}, they
ambushed me from behind ...{end}

Ugh ...!
My sword gets plenty of
attention, doesn't it?{06}{07}
Damn it, fall back!{end}

Show no mercy to the
rebels, only to the women.
That's my policy!{end}

In your dreams!{end}

I was careless ...{end}

So you're that stupid, eh?
I bet {02}'s
fallen in love too.{06}{07}
It'd be nice if you'd
have some common sense.{end}

Q, quiet!{end}

Unlike some women,
I don't pander to the base
desires of men.{06}{07}
It must be very tiring
to bother with.{end}

Oh, don't worry!
You're pretty good as you are!{end}

I'll release the master
from her shackles ...{06}{07}
Those known as
the Descendants of Light.{end}

Master, I dreamt I'd
fight beside you once more ...
before my death ...{06}{07}
Maybe in my next life,
I'll be so fortunate.{end}

Of all my students, you
possessed the greatest talent.{06}{07}
Why did you waste it
serving a tyrant?{end}

In truth, I studied your magic
to banish the darkness.{06}{07}
With that goal complete,
I pursue greater aims ...{06}{07}
And wish to explore
the limits of my power.{end}

It seems you've acquired
more power than
you're fit to handle.{end}

I can't die here.
I won't ... until I destroy
the darkness ...{end}

The Descendants of Light
have remained
true to their mission.{06}{07}
In the end, humans may not
need us ... they may be able to
fight darkness on their own.{06}{07}
But even if that's fact,
we cannot leave this
world to the Empire's care!{end}

Egbert, it was just 
a little longer ... {06}{07}
You could have brought
peace with the Descendants.{06}{07}
If you'd waited for us,
we'd have welcomed you.{end}

I'm sure my master is already
aware of the reasons. {06}{07}
In forbidden research,
I was nearly
possessed by demons.{06}{07}
My master would have me
face these creatures.
A terrifying prospect ...{06}{07}
I knew our strength was not
sufficient, and so, I chose
to aid His Majesty's Empire.{06}{07}
I had, at least, the power
and public favour to do that!{06}{07}
Hmph, it seems my speech
has gotten a bit lengthy.
We should finish things.{end}

Lady Jessica!{end}

I had orders from Lushiris
herself to guide the
Descendants of Light.{06}{07}
But, somehow, it looks like
this was their destiny ...{06}{07}
Cherie, I'm sorry I won't
be by your side any longer.
But please, live.{06}{07}
Leave this war behind you ...
and live as you please.{06}{07}
Live a happy life ...
For my sake ...{end}

Yes, Jessica ...{end}

Egbert ...{06}{07}
Please understand what
I'm trying to accomplish.{06}{07}
I need to wipe B{3a}ser and Chaos
from the face of this
world, to banish them eternally.{end}

...{06}{07}
It's up to you now,
Egbert, my student ...{06}{07}
I've done what I can ...
Go now, peacefully ...{end}

...{06}{07}
Hmmm, how could
this happen twice ...{end}

Farewell Jessica.
Farewell Cherie ...{end}

Aaahhh! No ...
I'm finished too ...{06}{07}
Egbert, I think I see ...
I see what you're trying to do.{06}{07}
To end B{3a}ser and Chaos
through overwhelming force ...
Can you succeed ...?{end}

It's up to you now, Egbert ...{06}{07}
Don't ...
worry about me ...{end}

Farewell, Jessica.{end}

So the Descendants
are no more?
The end of an era ...{end}

A true warrior takes
strength from
his enemies' defeat.{end}

Whew, that was quite a fight.
Tomorrow, I'll
need to take a load off.{end}

I'm pretty excited!{end}

I can't wait ...!{06}{07}
Egbert, you said you'd
teach me magic after the war,
so let's have some teaching!{end}

Think about it later, Hein.{end}

General Leon,
horrible news!{end}

Hmmm, Laird's scout.
What's wrong? Talk.{end}

General {02}!
It's a disaster!{end}

From your wounded expression,
something would
definitely seem amiss.{end}

It's urgent! You must
return to the Imperial Capital!{06}{07}
Castle Rayguard it's ... it's
under attack by monsters!{end}

What the!?
How can that be?{end}

Our soldiers have been
committed elsewhere, so we're
very much outnumbered!{06}{07}
His Highness and Laird are
commanding the defence!
Please return immediately!{end}

His Highness was an
outstanding general before
he ascended the throne.{06}{07}
Still, in a situation like this ...
even he'll need assistance.
We must slay the monsters.{06}{07}
If you're thinking of a plan,
then hurry up with it.{end}

The enemies have powerful
magicians as well.
They're not ordinary monsters.{end}

I know that well.{06}{07}
Your horses look tired to death.
We'll take care of this matter,
so please get some rest.{06}{07}
Everyone, let's go!
Make haste to
Castle Rayguard!{end}

You've come all the way here!?
No matter, we'll defeat you!{end}

What's all this blood ...
Uugghh ... Ugh.{end}

Burn by my magic!{end}

I'm finished ...{end}

I'm grateful ...
to have played a part in ...
this climactic battle ...{end}

You shall not pass!{end}

Jessica ...,
It's up to you from here on ...{end}

P, Princess ...{end}

I won't let those Imperials
think they can walk right in!{end}

This area was peaceful
before you bastards arrived!
I won't forgive you!{end}

{02}, prepare to
face my sword!{end}

...{06}{07}
{02} ...?
Where's {02} ...?{end}

I'm over here, Cherie ...{end}

I, I didn't expect
to beat you ...{06}{07}
But I didn't give in ...
At least I ... did that ...{end}

Please don't ...!
You've said enough, Cherie.{end}

I've always wanted to fight
beside you, {02} ...{06}{07}
The life of a Princess
wasn't for me ...{end}

...{end}

You should know,
{02} ...{06}{07}
All my life, people have
thought of me as royalty.{06}{07}
You were the first ...
to treat me like a person.
I ... respect you for that ...{06}{07}
Sorry, ...
I'm confusing, aren't I ...?{06}{07}
But, ... I ...
love ... you ...{end}

Cherie, ... you deserved
another life ...{06}{07}
You were so full of life
and smiling whenever we met.
Cherie, I, I know ...{06}{07}
...{06}{07}
I know such are the sacrifices
of war, and I will
continue on my chosen path.{06}{07}
I acted for El Sallia's peace,
now and forever. For that,
I hope ... you will forgive me.{end}

The Descendants of Light
were forced into war
because of their heritage.{06}{07}
Just as the Princess had
to fight because of hers ...{end}

I remember ...{06}{07}
Keith often said that
Cherie would
sneak from the castle.{end}

Everyone, please understand.
I was prepared for this.
I'll be all right ...{06}{07}
I won't stop, won't give in,
and won't fall back until I
defeat the forces of darkness!{06}{07}
If I don't accomplish that,
Cherie will never rest in peace.{end}

I'll show you
how Kalxath avenges
her aerial squadron!{end}

M, my apologies!
I couldn't avenge them ...{end}

Don't be so conceited!{end}

Foolish ...{end}

We'll retaliate
fast and hard!{end}

Thank you, everyone,
for your support in this battle.
May Lushiris watch over us ...{06}{07}
{02} better be ready,
because the Empire is finished!{end}

It's time to show our
true glory and strength!{06}{07}
Everyone, strike now!
Aaaaahhhh!{end}

Damn you!{end}

F, fuck ...{end}

Damn Imperials!
Don't let
them escape alive!{end}

I'm taking revenge for
Scott and Aaron!{end}

Sorry, people of Salrath ...
I couldn't avenge your lord ...{end}

I won't lose!
Until I defeat you all,
I desire nothing else!{end}

Loren, Scott I'll ...
be nearby soon ...{end}

...{06}{07}
Master, you've fulfilled
your duties admirably.{06}{07}
Please rest in peace ...
and leave this
world to our hands.{end}
