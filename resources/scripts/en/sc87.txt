If this is your first time in
El Sallia, an introduction to battle
tactics may aid you on your quest.{end}

Would you like me to
explain the basics of battle?{end}

Your units consist of
commanders and soldiers.{06}{07}
The commanders are yourself
and your companions.
Soldiers will be hired at the
start of every scenario.{06}{07}
Purchasing troops is a vital
part of preparing for battle.{end}

Do you need an explanation of
what command range is?{end}

At the beginning of a battle,
you should try to keep your units
nearby their commander.{06}{07}
The blinking blue area
around a commander is his
or her command range.{06}{07}
Soldiers within this zone
will receive bonuses to both
their attack and defence.{end}

Would you like me to explain
how to recover your unit's HP?{end}

A unit adjacent to its
commander will recover 3 HP
at the start of its turn.{06}{07}
The only other way to
recover unit HP is by casting
clerical magic.{06}{07}
Keep in mind, as a
unit's HP decreases, so
does its attack power.{end}

Would you like me to explain
how to recover a commander's HP?{end}

A commander can regain
3 HP and 2 MP by selecting
the Rally command.{end}

Would you like an
explanation of troop affinities?{end}

Each unit type is characterised by
unique attributes which, in combat,
may be beneficial or detrimental.{06}{07}
There are five major properties:{06}{07}
Infantry are strong to spearmen
but weak against cavalry.
Spearmen are strong to
cavalry but weak against infantry.{06}{07}
Cavalry are strong against infantry
but weak against spearmen.
Sea units are slow on
land but fast in the water.{06}{07}
Flying units have excellent
mobility and gain an attack
advantage by being airborne,
but they are weak to bowmen.{06}{07}
Bowmen can attack the
enemy from a distance and are
strong against flying units.{06}{07}
However, when bowmen are
caught in a direct attack, they
can easily be wiped out.{06}{07}
Carefully consider the
map's terrain, as well as
commander arrangement, prior
to hiring your troops.{end}

Would you like an explanation
of how to build EXP?{end}

When a troop defeats an
enemy unit in combat, EXP is
awarded to its commander.{06}{07}
When an enemy commander is
defeated, all troops under its
command will perish as well.{06}{07}
However, no EXP will be gained
from the troops' demise.{06}{07}
That's why it's best
to defeat all troops before
their commander.{end}

Would you like me to explain
how to position your commanders?{end}

Before conducting your
sortie, you must position all
commanders on the map.{06}{07}
Commanders to be
positioned will have their names
displayed in bright white.{06}{07}
Depending on the stage, there
may be times when the
arrangement is predetermined.{06}{07}
In these such arrangements,
you cannot modify the
commander positioning, but you
can still buy troops and items.{end}

Hopefully you now have a
better grasp of battle tactics.{06}{07}
Don't forget to hire troops.
A lone soldier can
be the deciding factor
between victory and defeat.{end}

And now, I return you to
your world below.
May your quest be successful.{end}
