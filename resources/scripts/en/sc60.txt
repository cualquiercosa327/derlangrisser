Those two have held
their ground quite well.{06}{07}
But I don't suspect
they can keep this up.{end}

Damn! Next time,
I won't leave you standing!{end}

Don't be reckless, Laird.
Conserve your strength.{end}

Your Majesty,
you must be tired.{06}{07}
I'll hold them here!
Please, stay back!{end}

I have no right to be the Kaiser
if I'm too weak to defend
my own castle.{06}{07}
We're doing quite well.
Keep up the good work.{end}

It's sad how they'll be dying
at their own doorstep.{06}{07}
They really should
have known when to quit.{end}

Stand back, fiends.
You will not harm
His Majesty!{end}

Fuck! They're here early.{end}

So it's Sonya ...{end}

General Leon!{end}

Excellent timing, Leon.{06}{07}
You're probably tired from
your journey, but could you
dispose of these incompetents?{end}

Please, take it easy!{end}

Stay safe, Your Majesty.{06}{07}
Colonel Laird,
protect the Kaiser!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

All right!
Don't spare anyone.
Cut them to ribbons!{end}

Split up and
attack both flanks!{06}{07}
Esto and Osto will go for
Bernhardt. The rest of
us will take on {02}.{end}

{font3}Yes, Sonya!{end}

{font3}Crush humans ...!{end}

Hmmm, ... scatter their
reinforcements first!{end}

Sorry, {02}.{end}

Rohga, don't say a word.
I already know.{06}{07}
Go to Sonya and talk to her,
and we'll cover your back.{06}{07}
If you succeed,
we may have an easy victory.{end}

I owe you one!{end}

Something seems to be
stuck in a hole by your feet.{06}{07}

Will you search the hole?{end}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

The forces of darkness
are much stronger now ...
Is this Alhazard's doing?{end}

We must aid them,
and to do that ...
I'm sorry.{end}

Forgive me, Sonya.
This is for the Kaiser!{end}

Brother!
You're no different from
any other human!{06}{07}
You all hate me for being
a half-breed monster!{end}

Damn it ...
I couldn't persuade her ...{end}

Sorry, {02}.
Take care of the Kaiser ...{end}

This is a harsh battle.{end}

Uugghhh, ...
beaten by ...
worthless monsters ...{end}

I had no idea monsters
were so capable ...{06}{07}
Alhazard's power is amazing.{end}

The Empire fields the finest
commanders of this generation.
You'll know that first hand.{end}

Hah hah hah ...
I remember when we'd hire
any mercenary off the street!{end}

Arrogant little girl.
Yes, you're Rohga's
sister for certain.{06}{07}
The Goddess Lushiris will
make sure you speak nothing
of this to B{3a}ser ...{end}

Don't even mention
that disgusting name!{end}

Do you think a bunch of
slavering beasts can storm
a castle? What a joke!{end}

Arrgh ...!
I've come so far ...
M, my dream ...{end}

Your Highness!{end}

Hah hah hah! With the way
things are going, even
Master B{3a}ser will be pleased!{06}{07}
The era of darkness has begun!{end}

No, that can't be!
Your Majesty, ...
I couldn't protect you.{end}

Laird, hold your ground!{06}{07}
Keep a tight circle around
the Kaiser and secure his
position until we get there!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

No one will get through
if Laird's in the way,
that's for sure.{end}

Leon ... I, I ...
think this is it for me ...{06}{07}
His Highness,
protect him ...{end}

Laird, I won't allow you to die.{06}{07}
To fall now, after everything
we've accomplished ...
No, you're not permitted.{06}{07}
Stand up, old friend.
This battle will soon be over.{end}

My ... apologies ...
General Leon.{06}{07}
Please, ... see our
dream through ...
and help our Kaiser ...{end}

Laird, ...
Laird ...?{06}{07}
Damn this ...
Hell won't see you before me!{06}{07}
Open your eyes, Laird.
Please, open your eyes!{end}

We've lost another ally ...{end}

Your Highness ...
I think ... I'm ... finished ...{end}

That's enough.
Don't say any more.{end}

Your dream ... Kaiser ...
unite the continent ... please ...{end}

Laird, I won't let our
life's work go to waste.{06}{07}
Without a doubt, we will
soon see a unified continent!{end}

Grr ... At this rate ...
Bernhardt, you've been lucky,
but you're not leaving here!{end}

What's wrong, little girl?
Has the attack already ended?{end}

Be quiet!
We won't let you live, not after
all the demons you've killed!{end}

Why don't you give up already?
Chased all the way here and
you still feel like fighting?{end}

I won't let you
foil B{3a}ser's plans.{06}{07}
That is the first step for a
world where there are no
more humans!{06}{07}
I can kill you Imperials alone!
None of you will escape,
I'm going to kill you all!{end}

Stop it, Sonya!{end}

Shut up!
Don't order me around!{end}

Die!{end}

Stop it, Sonya!{end}

My brother is terrible!{06}{07}
Get in my way and
you'll end up like this!{end}

Aaahhh--!{06}{07}
H, How ...
How dare you ...{06}{07}
Next time we meet,
B{3a}ser and I are going
to bury you for good!{end}

{font3}Uugghh!{end}

{font3}Arrghh!{end}

{font3}Ooohhh!{end}

{font3}Aaahh--!{end}

{font3}Oohh ... oh ...{end}

Ugh ... what power ...{end}

{font3}Oohh ...{end}

You are fools for
turning against B{3a}ser.{06}{07}
Maybe Hell's the best
place for your craziness!{end}

{font3}How could ...
{font3}mere mortals end a
{font3}lord such as I ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Gwarg--!
{font3}Th, They have ...
{font3}Langrisser--!{end}

Sonya ...
Stand back ...{end}

{font3}Uugghh ...{end}

{font3}Uugghh ... Ugh ...{end}

Hmmm ... Somehow,
we forced them back.{end}

Your Highness, you're safe!{end}

Today, we have conquered.{06}{07}
B{3a}ser will, however, regroup
and launch a concerted strike.{06}{07}
At that time, only our
greatest, perhaps miraculous,
effort will bring victory.{end}

They're here much
earlier than we planned.{06}{07}
Letting them unlock
Alhazard was a bad idea.
It will be a liability.{end}

Pursue them immediately.{end}

They won't give us any rest,
so we'll make our stand here.{06}{07}
B{3a}ser has recovered.
If we let him go unchecked,
the world will be damned.{end}

Yes, I see.
We'll surely defeat
the darkness next time.{end}

Wait, Leon!
Please take this lance.{end}

What is this?{end}

I present you this gift
for liberating us from
the savages.{end}

Hmmm, ... it appears
expertly crafted.
I'll make good use of it.{end}

Obtained Inferno Lance.{end}

Now, let's go!
We'll defeat B{3a}ser this time!{end}

Sonya, stop fighting for B{3a}ser.
He's manipulating you!{end}

You're wrong!
Over time, B{3a}ser has
come to understand me!{06}{07}
Next you'll say that the
humans who persecuted me
are really trying to help!{end}

No, think about it.{06}{07}
Maybe if you'd never met that
creep, humans wouldn't have
looked down on you.{06}{07}
Don't you see?
B{3a}ser's been warping you
to be his obedient dog!{end}

I am ...
a dog ...!?{06}{07}
Don't try to condemn me.
Brother, you are one
of the Empire's dogs!{end}

Actually, I joined by my own
free will, just like you can.
Come on and give it a shot.{end}

...{06}{07}
Brother is only saying that
because he doesn't understand
how terrifying B{3a}ser can be.{06}{07}
I can no longer escape from
the darkness, ... from B{3a}ser.{06}{07}
I don't have the strength
to win this battle any more.{06}{07}
I'm withdrawing for now,
but next time, I won't hold
back, Brother!{end}

Sonya!{end}
