Whew, we landed
ahead of schedule.
What luck ...{end}

Keep moving.
If we want to seal both swords,
we can't stop to rest.{end}

Just be glad
we defeated B{3a}ser.{end}

Yes, and don't worry.
The Imperial cat shall soon
hunt down its mice!{end}

How fortunate those
mice have scurried here ...{end}

Our favourite enemies ...
We'll bombard them
before going ashore.{end}

I've been waiting for you,
{02} ...
And you too, Egbert.{end}

Lester ...{end}

Lester, I must extend
my gratitude.{06}{07}
I don't know how to repay
your watching over
Jessica in my stead.{end}

What empty words ...{06}{07}
Egbert, I'm thankful
one of us will die today.{06}{07}
You destroyed Jessica's
home and broke her heart. 
You're no friend of hers.{06}{07}
In fact, she came back
so the world wouldn't fall
to scum like you.{end}

To end the darkness ...
Jessica returned
for that reason alone.{end}

Isn't that Bernhardt's purpose?
To rally the continent
and wipe out darkness?{end}

Ever since B{3a}ser's revival,
I've sought an effective means
to combat the darkness.{06}{07}
I settled, in the end,
on overwhelming
military strength.{06}{07}
I might have waited with
Jessica for the Descendants,
but time was short ...
and I joined the Empire.{06}{07}
The secondary effects
of that decision,
I'd rather not discuss.{end}

Oh, that's great.
So we've both been trying
to do the same thing.{06}{07}
Funny, our plan wouldn't
have soaked the
whole continent in blood!{end}

What's done is done.
The Empire is secure.{06}{07}
Any resistance will
be quelled or crushed.{end}

You've always been impressive,
with your bold
statements and strategies ...{06}{07}
And I think I've
finally figured you out.{06}{07}
You can't bring peace,
you just hide behind it.
What a convenient excuse.{end}

Grrr ...
Come and get it!{end}

It'll be tough fighting
in a place like this.{end}

Ready the men!
I'll hold our enemies.{end}

That's right.
We have to get the
troops ashore!{end}

If we can pin them,
we'll win this fight for sure!{end}

I know!
We'll bring Jessica
some good news ...!{end}

Hah hah!{end}

This is dangerous.
Kill them if you can.{end}

Hey, Egbert.
There's one last thing
I want to know ...{end}

Ask what you'd like.{end}

Up until now, B{3a}ser's
resurrection
was simply an omen.{06}{07}
"The world will
fall into darkness, ..."
because of him, presumably.{06}{07}
Well, I heard from Jessica
the reverse is true ...{06}{07}
B{3a}ser doesn't bring chaos,
chaos brings B{3a}ser. Only a
bloody world will awaken him.{06}{07}
What's your opinion?{end}

...{06}{07}
I agree with the theory.
His Majesty, however,
should not know this.{end}

Then why did you agree
to the Empire's conquest?{06}{07}
Did you want to
reawaken the darkness?{end}

Even if I'd known,
I wouldn't have
changed my decision.{06}{07}
El Sallia's strife, continued
indefinitely, would surely
bring eternal darkness.{06}{07}
However, we Imperials
believe our war
will end in lasting peace.{06}{07}
Compared to all the blood
in history, we're
making a small sacrifice.{end}

So you're saying your
invasion is justified?{06}{07}
In war, justice
means nothing!{end}

Your beliefs are flawed.{06}{07}
Peace will never come
through forcing your ideology.
Mankind will always resist.{06}{07}
True bliss can only come
through mutual understanding.{06}{07}
That's my conclusion.{06}{07}
Our Empire wishes to
both eliminate the darkness
and govern justly.{06}{07}
Your time will soon be up,
Maybe you'll finally learn
how foolish it is to defy us.{end}

There is an old
wooden box lying here.{06}{07}

Will you open it?{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{end}

Clear the way!{end}

Give up, Lester.{end}

You're kidding!
No way am I losing here.{end}

I suffered much to obtain
Langrisser and Alhazard ...{end}

Arrghh ...!
I won't survive this
much longer ...{end}

Fuck! How careless ...{end}

This wound is worse ...
than I thought.
I'm falling back.{end}

I'll deck you right in the
face if you don't back off!{end}

I could use a rest.
I'm leaving
the situation to you.{end}

Just one more ... 
The Empire's victory will be
decided with one more breath!{end}

Nooooo!
Don't get angry ...{end}

Ah hah hah ...
I can see my reputation
intimidates you!{end}

When you disappeared
so suddenly ...{06}{07}
Do you know how much
Jessica grieved for you?{end}

...{06}{07}
Ideals can easily
separate people.{06}{07}
It was only a matter of time.{end}

Tsk! Too soft!{end}

Fall back!
Save your strength for
the next battle!{end}

I thought B{3a}ser's
war on humans would
make me happy.{06}{07}
I was wrong ...
Fighting and killing for
no reason is wrong.{06}{07}
But this fight isn't pointless.
This is our last chance
to bring a peaceful world.{06}{07}
With brother Rohga,
I won't lose to you!{end}

Aaahh--!
I won't forget this!{end}

For your own good,
I won't let you pass.{end}

What?
What do you mean!?{end}

Hah hah.
Don't even try to hurt me!{end}

Egbert!{06}{07}
With all your pondering,
the best you came up with
was continental war!?{end}

The answer is self-evident.
I have no interest
in further discussion.{end}

Ugggh--!{06}{07}
Heh heh heh ...
What a grave mistake.
Heh ...{end}

Lester ...{end}

Egbert.{06}{07}
I don't know whether
you've been right
or wrong in all this ...{06}{07}
But I've always thought
of you as a brother.{06}{07}
And as a brother ...
I'll tell you that Jessica
doesn't want to fight you.{end}

...{06}{07}
I can't promise anything
in that regard.{06}{07}
If Jessica opposes us,
my loyalty's with the Empire.{end}

Oh, I should have guessed.
A typical response ...{06}{07}
I guess I'll never understand
why you ran off and
fucked over your friends ...{06}{07}
Kind of like {02} ...{end}

Speaking of you,
{02} ...{06}{07}
It's best if you
don't go any further.{end}

How do you respond?{end}

I'll think about it.{end}

If you go on, you'll
really be in for it ...
Hah hah ...{06}{07}
Staying here might
be a better idea.
Take it from me ...{06}{07}
Fuck this ...
My eyes are all blurry ...{06}{07}
Egbert ... told ...
I ... haven't told ...
Good ... bye ...{end}

Soon, this body will pass away,
and I'll see you again.{06}{07}
When that time comes,
let's visit that old house ...{end}

Lester. I'm sorry ...{end}

What will you do, {02}?
Will you follow his suggestion
and remain here?{end}

No. I've come too far.{06}{07}
I'll see this through.
The alternative is regret.{end}

Oh ...?
Then let's continue.{end}

Farewell, ... Lester.{end}

We'll take the front lines
with our aerial attack!{end}

I don't want to die!{end}

Attack them from the sky!
Don't give them
any room to breathe!{end}

Hah hah!{end}

Feed my Dragon!{end}

Arrgh! Gaahh--!{end}

This port will
become your grave!{end}

Gahhh--!{end}

I'll give it all I've got
before I fall to you!
{end}

Take the battle to the sea!{end}

T, too strong!{end}

S, sea ...
Return to the sea.{end}

Uugghh--!{end}

Swarm them!
Sting them to death!{end}

Is, is this it ...?{end}

Bleeding ...
It won't stop ...!
Aaarrrghh ...{end}

We are Sir Lester's elite corps.
We fight to the end!{end}

Your strength
isn't unexpected ...{end}

We've trained for this day
and are in top form!{end}

Lester ...{end}

Is this ... the end ...{end}

Fuck! Am I all that's left!?{06}{07}
Well, someone's gonna join
me on the trip to Hell!{end}

Don't mess
with my navy!{end}

You thought you
could stop us with your
pathetic ability?{end}
