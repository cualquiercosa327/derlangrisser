No!
Let me go!{end}

Hmmm.{end}

Aaahh!{end}

You're struggling in vain.
Calm yourself--
escape is impossible.{end}

Rest long and well for the
resurrection ceremony.
It really is very draining.{end}

...{end}

Silence is fine.{06}{07}
Just remember,
our kindness is a courtesy.{end}

How go the preparations?{end}

They are progressing smoothly.
By the way, is it okay for you
to go so long without resting?{end}

Hah hah hah ...
Who the hell do you think
you are dealing with?{06}{07}
A degree of magical
power and focus will be
required for the ritual ...{06}{07}
But these are simple
things for me.{end}

Ah, you can trust
your limits then.{end}

Faias!{end}

{font3}You called,
{font3}Master B{3a}ser ...?{end}

The Descendants of Light
are headed here as we speak.{06}{07}
Make certain
you stop them.{06}{07}
The ritual must go
exactly as planned.{end}

{font3}Hah hah, yes ...
{font3}absolutely!{end}

Lester, are we
nearing Velzeria?{end}

Don't you worry.
We're headed in the
right direction.{06}{07}
Leave all the navigation
to me. After all ...,
I am a man of the sea!{end}

We're lucky the villagers
were willing to
lend us these boats.{end}

Yeah, but still ...
It took us a long time before
we were able to set off ...{06}{07}
We have to make
up for lost time ...{end}

What!?
Is that the enemy?{end}

{font3}Ho ho ho ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}How lucky for
{font3}us, it's the
{font3}Descendants of Light!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}This is as far as
{font3}you walking
{font3}corpses will get!{end}

That's a lot of
monsters, {02} ...{end}

Be careful!{06}{07}
Their forces consist
mainly of aerial
and naval units.{end}

This water is going
to seriously slow
down our movement ...{end}

Flying and naval units,
encircle and guard
our ground troops.{end}

We'll meet them head on!
There's no other
way but straight through!{end}

{font3}I have an old score
{font3}to settle with you,
{font3}Descendants of Light.{end}

{font3}Especially that
{font3}red-haired punk, you!{end}

What score could you
possibly have with us?
We have never met.{end}

{font3}Ha ha ha!
{font3}You ... really don't
{font3}remember me?{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}I had hoped my
{font3}face would haunt
{font3}your nightmares for
{font3}all eternity.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}B{3a}ser ordered me
{font3}to massacre the
{font3}Descendants of Light.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}But when I finally
{font3}hunted you down,
{font3}this crumpled old
{font3}fool got in my way ...{end}

An old ...!{06}{07}
You ... then it was you!
You are the one
who murdered Doren!{end}

{font3}Doren ...
{font3}Hmmm, Doren ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Heh heh ...
{font3}Oh yes, that was his
{font3}name, I believe.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}That little bastard
{font3}dealt me a scratch that
{font3}aches even this day.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}But he's dead, and
{font3}you will soon rejoin him.
{font3}Today, I will dance
{font3}in your blood!{end}

For years I wandered ...
asking myself what I would do
if I found his murderer.{06}{07}
I will never forgive you.
Prepare yourself!{end}

{font3}Aaahhh--!{end}

{font3}Gurgle ...{end}

{font3}Gwa ha ha ha!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}You despise me?
{font3}You want to kill me?{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Hate and anguish
{font3}are my source of power!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Punk, let's see if you
{font3}still remember what
{font3}that old husk taught!{end}

Heh ...{end}

{02},
don't give in to anger!{06}{07}
If you fight with rage
and pain in your heart, you'll
be no better than him!{end}

{font3}That girl Liana
{font3}looked really tasty.{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Heh heh heh ...{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Chop up their bodies
{font3}and drink their blood.
{font3}Drive their friends
{font3}mad with fear. {end}

Faias!
You won't do what you like!
We will rescue Liana!{end}

{font3}Wryyyyyyyyyy!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}Your words
{font3}are meaningless
{font3}if you can't defeat me!{end}

Watch out for
enemy sea units!{06}{07}
They have a
superior defence
while on water.{end}

Hmmm ... 
It'll be tough to lure
them onto the boats.{end}

Don't worry, some thunder
magic will send them
running to anything dry!{06}{07}
That spell really
stings when they're
in the water!{end}

Then use Thunder if
you can. It should make
quick work of them.{end}

{font3}Let's do
{font3}this, knaves!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}B{3a}ser won't tolerate
{font3}a failure here!
{font3}This is my last stand!{end}

Faias ...{end}

Liana ...{end}

{font3}Fools of light!
{font3}You did well in
{font3}getting this far!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}But your good luck
{font3}won't last forever!{end}

Don't take me lightly!{end}

Let's do this!{end}

I was too careless ...{end}

Argh!{end}

Ouch!
Why did I have
to lose--{end}

Ugh ...
Has my time come
to an end?{end}

Argh!
How could I
lose here.{end}

Ohhh ...
Losing is no
fun at all--{end}

I didn't train
hard enough ...{end}

Die!{end}

{font3}Grrr!{06}{07}
{font3}{font3}When I killed
{font3}that old wretch, 
{font3}I should have finished
{font3}you off too!{end}

You son of a bitch!
This is for Doren!{end}

What did you say!?{end}

{font3}Ugh!
{font3}M, Master B{3a}ser!
{font3}P, please forgive me!{end}

{font3}Ohhhh--!{end}

{font3}Ugghh ...{end}

{font3}Grrrr--!{end}

{font3}Arrrghh!{end}

{font3}Aaahh--!{end}

{font3}Ugggh ...{end}

{font3}Aaahh--argghh!{end}

{font3}Oooohh ...!{end}

{font3}Ooohh ...!{end}

{font3}Grrr--! Grr ...{end}

He was slain because I was
a Descendant of Light ...{06}{07}
Doren gave his life in
exchange for mine ...{06}{07}
Everyone close to me dies ...
I ... I cannot protect anyone.{end}

{02} ...
You were destined to be born
a Descendant of Light.{06}{07}
But the reason your allies
fight beside you isn't
because of your heritage.{06}{07}
It's because we
believe in you.{end}

Cherie is absolutely right!{end}

Thanks everyone.
It's still not too late.{06}{07}
We'll combine all our
strength, prevent Alhazard's
revival, and protect this world!{06}{07}
I want you all to know ...
I couldn't have
done this alone.{end}

But, we've definitely
more to do than just
stopping Alhazard's revival!{end}

Land ho!{end}

I see it too!
I can see the shoreline!{end}

At last, 
Velzeria's just ahead.{end}

At last,
we're finally here.
Velzeria ...{end}

Let's go straight
for their headquarters.{end}

The enemy has been
quiet ... I think we
can expect an ambush.{06}{07}
Let's stay focused
from here on out.{end}

Everyone ...
Velzeria is just ahead!
Don't give up!{end}
