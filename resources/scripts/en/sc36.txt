No!
Let me go!{end}

Hmmm.{end}

Aaahh!{end}

You're struggling in vain.
Calm yourself--
escape is impossible.{end}

Rest long and well for the
resurrection ceremony.
It really is very draining.{end}

...{end}

Silence is fine.{06}{07}
Just remember,
our kindness is a courtesy.{end}

How go the preparations?{end}

They are progressing smoothly.
By the way, is it okay for you
to go so long without resting?{end}

Hah hah hah ...
Who the hell do you think
you are dealing with?{06}{07}
A degree of magical
power and focus will be
required for the ritual ...{06}{07}
But these are simple
things for me.{end}

Ah, you can trust
your limits then.{end}

Faias!{end}

{font3}You called,
Master B{3a}ser ...?{end}

The Descendants of Light
are headed here as we speak.{06}{07}
Make certain
you stop them.{06}{07}
The ritual must go
exactly as planned.{end}

{font3}Hah hah, yes ...
absolutely!{end}

Lester, are we
nearing Velzeria?{end}

Don't you worry.
We're headed in the
right direction.{06}{07}
Leave all the navigation
to me. After all ...,
I am a man of the sea!{end}

We're lucky the villagers
were willing to
lend us these boats.{end}

Yeah, but still ...
It took us a long time before
we were able to set off ...{06}{07}
We have to make
up for lost time ...{end}

What!?
Is that the enemy?{end}

{font3}Ho ho ho ...{06}{07}
{font3}How lucky for
us, it's the
Descendants of Light!{06}{07}
{font3}This is as far as
you walking
corpses will get!{end}

That's a lot of
monsters, {02} ...{end}

Be careful!{06}{07}
Their forces consist
mainly of aerial
and naval units.{end}

This water is going
to seriously slow
down our movement ...{end}

Flying and naval units,
encircle and guard
our ground troops.{end}

We'll meet them head on!
There's no other
way but straight through!{end}

{font3}I have an old score
to settle with you,
Descendants of Light.{end}

{font3}Especially that
red-haired punk, you!{end}

What are you
talking about?{end}

{font3}You really
don't know?{06}{07}
{font3}B{3a}ser ordered me
to massacre the
Descendants of Light.{06}{07}
{font3}But while I was
searching you out,
an old fool
got in my way ...{end}

What!
That ..., that means
you killed Doren!?{end}

{font3}Heh heh ...
Oh yes, that was his
name I believe.{06}{07}
{font3}That bastard dealt
me a scratch that
aches even this day.{06}{07}
{font3}But he's dead, and soon
you'll go to join him.
Today, I will dance
in your blood!{end}

I'll never forgive you!
Prepare yourself!{end}

{font3}Aaahhh--!{end}

{font3}Gurgle ...{end}

{font3}Gwa ha ha ha!{06}{07}
{font3}You despise me?
You want to kill me?{06}{07}
{font3}Hate and anguish
are my source of power!{06}{07}
{font3}Punk, let's see if you
still remember what
that old husk taught!{end}

Heh ...{end}

{02},
don't give in to anger!{06}{07}
If you fight with rage
and pain in your heart, you'll
be no better than him!{end}

{font3}That girl Liana
looked really tasty.{06}{07}
{font3}Heh heh heh ...{06}{07}
{font3}Chop up their bodies
and drink their blood.
Drive their friends
mad with fear. {end}

Faias!
You won't do what you like!
We will rescue Liana!{end}

{font3}Wryyyyyyyyyy!{06}{07}
{font3}Your words
are meaningless
if you can't defeat me!{end}

Watch out for
enemy sea units!{06}{07}
They have a
superior defence
while on water.{end}

Hmmm ... 
It'll be tough to lure
them onto the boats.{end}

Don't worry, some thunder
magic will send them
running to anything dry!{06}{07}
That spell really
stings when they're
in the water!{end}

Then use Thunder if
you can. It should make
quick work of them.{end}

{font3}Let's do
this, knaves!{06}{07}
{font3}B{3a}ser won't tolerate
a failure here!
This is my last stand!{end}

Faias ...{end}

Liana ...{end}

Whipper snappers!
You did well in
getting this far!{06}{07}
But your good luck
won't last forever!{end}

Don't take me lightly!{end}

Let's do this!{end}

I was too careless ...{end}

Argh!{end}

Ouch!
Why did I have
to lose--{end}

Ugh ...
Has my time come
to an end?{end}

Argh!
How could I
lose here.{end}

Ohhh ...
Losing is no
fun at all--{end}

I didn't train
hard enough ...{end}

Die!{end}

{font3}Grrr!{06}{07}
{font3}When I killed
that old wretch, 
I should have finished
you off too!{end}

You son of a bitch!
This is for Doren!{end}

What did you say!?{end}

{font3}Ugh!
M, Master B{3a}ser!
P, please forgive me!{end}

{font3}Ohhhh--!{end}

{font3}Ugghh ...{end}

{font3}Grrrr--!{end}

{font3}Arrrghh!{end}

{font3}Aaahh--!{end}

{font3}Ugggh ...{end}

{font3}Aaahh--argghh!{end}

{font3}Oooohh ...!{end}

{font3}Ooohh ...!{end}

{font3}Grrr--! Grr ...{end}

He was slain because I was
a Descendant of Light ... {06}{07}
Doren gave his life in
exchange for mine ...{06}{07}
Everyone close to me dies ...
I can't protect anyone.{end}

{02} ...
You were destined to be born
a Descendant of Light.{06}{07}
But the reason your allies
fight beside you isn't
because of your heritage.{06}{07}
It's because we
believe in you.{end}

Cherie is absolutely right!{end}

Thanks everyone.
It's still not too late.{06}{07}
We'll combine all our
strength, prevent Alhazard's
revival, and protect this world!{06}{07}
I want you all to know ...
I couldn't have
done this alone.{end}

But, we've definitely
more to do than just
stopping Alhazard's revival!{end}

Land ho!{end}

I see it too!
I can see the shoreline!{end}

At last, 
Velzeria's just ahead.{end}

At last,
we're finally here.
Velzeria ...{end}

Let's go straight
for their headquarters.{end}

The enemy has been
quiet ... I think we
can expect an ambush.{06}{07}
Let's stay focused
from here on out.{end}

Everyone ...
Velzeria is just ahead!
Don't give up!{end}
