Most well done!
With your help, we obtained
both Alhazard and Langrisser.{end}

With the two swords,
Your Majesty's desires can
finally be realised.{end}

We finally have the
power we need to unite
our continent.{end}

One land, one king!
The age of war
should be over for good.{end}

However, there remains
one problem ...{end}

The maidens who possessed
the power to seal away the
swords have both perished.{06}{07}
Until the swords have been
put to rest for good, the
possibility of a new holy war
will remain ever present.{end}

We must make sure
Alhazard's power never falls
into evil hands again.{06}{07}
{02} ...{end}

Yes, Your Majesty?{end}

I entrust you to aide the other
imperial generals in this task.{end}

Yes, Sire!
I do my best not to disappoint
His Majesty!{end}

Our first battle has ended.{06}{07}
I trust you shall continue
to do your best to succeed.
For the sake of a peaceful
tomorrow, go forth!{end}

Yes, my Liege!{end}

Rohga!{end}

Where are you headed?{end}

My journey has ended ...
There is nothing left for me ...{end}

In your travels to find Sonya ...
what you found must have been
truly heartbreaking ...{end}

I should have done more ...
I could have done more ...
Sonya should not have died.{06}{07}
Since I can't continue fighting
my way from country to
country any more, I'm giving
up my days as a mercenary.{06}{07}
I don't know what the future
holds for me, but I can't
just dwell on Sonya's fate
and sit on my ass!{end}

Why not just take a vacation?
You can always return one day
when you feel differently.{end}

I can't promise anything.{06}{07}
But, if I do change my mind,
I might show up to make your
lives miserable for a while!{end}

Uugghh!{end}

H, help me ...
Gaah--!{end}

I, impossible, the strength they
possess is inhuman!{end}

But if we cannot break
through them, we will never be
able to grab Alhazard ...!{end}

The Empire is the guardian
of peace in El Sallia!
Why do you attempt to invade?{end}

No quarter shall be
shown to those who would
use Alhazard for evil!{end}

Damn you ...
Retreat!{end}

These guys were a joke.
It seems our enemies are
growing ever weaker.{end}

So it seems.{end}

There will never be an end
to those who seek Alhazard
and Langrisser for evil.{06}{07}
One day when we've all passed
on, who will be left to protect
them from such hooligans ...?
I have a dream.{06}{07}
A dream that one day, those
who aim for the Dark Blade
to realise their greedy
ambitions will cease to be.{end}
