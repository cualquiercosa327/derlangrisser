Great and gloried Chaos,
reveal your splendour!{end}

Don't wear yourself out, girl ...
This will be quite taxing.{end}

Hey, Egbert.{06}{07}
His Majesty ordered our
presence here, so why is 
B{3a}ser unsealing the blade?{end}

This too is one
of our orders.{06}{07}
We are to leave things
to him and observe.{end}

Hmmm ...{end}

I'm still shocked to
find out about L{37}na.{06}{07}
How could Liana
have had a twin?{end}

It is simply the destiny
of the one born to
be the Maiden of Light.{06}{07}
There must be balance, and
hence, a Maiden of Darkness.{06}{07}
B{3a}ser abducted L{37}na
while she was very young
for his own ends ...{end}

So he was planning
this for quite a long time.{end}

The shrine maidens
will dissolve the seal, but
that is not enough.{06}{07}
The sword requires energy,
and L{37}na must offer hers.{end}

Ultimate darkness
lies within this blade.{06}{07}
Embrace your darkest
desires, Liana ..., and
unleash Alhazard's might!{06}{07}
{font4}Klatu Verata
Niktue Geweald ...
Ai Alhazard, Ai Alhazard!{end}

Is, is the seal broken?{end}

Heh heh heh ...,
What terrific energy ...!{end}

Aaahhh ... Such power! 
Now I am truly the
Prince of Darkness ...{06}{07}
Empire, you've served
or, rather, outlived
your purpose.{end}

You'll find you're
wrong about that.{end}

No, with Alhazard in my hand,
you're all highly unnecessary.{06}{07}
Not that it
wasn't fun to toy
with you, but ...{06}{07}
Arise, my servants!{end}

Y, you called, Master?{end}

Ah, Sonya.
Alhazard is now mine.{06}{07}
Please, slaughter
these Imperials while I
recover from the ritual.{06}{07}
Use this rod if you like.{end}

Y, yes ...
Thank you, Master!{end}

Sonya obtained the Dark Rod.{end}

No ...
Sonya ...? Why?{end}

Listen, everyone.{06}{07}
Either we take Alhazard,
or B{3a}ser will fill
this world with misery.{end}

That's right.{06}{07}
Under his control,
everyone will die
or become demonic.{end}

Everyone, our mission
is to retake Alhazard!{end}

You'll pay for your
deception, B{3a}ser!{end}

You're damned
right he will!{06}{07}
Against the Empire,
he's as good as dead ...
just like anyone who would
oppose the Kaiser!{end}

It is good of you
to gather here for us.{06}{07}
It will make the fight
that much more interesting!{end}

Maybe the "Prince of Darkness"
can entertain us longer
than the Descendants were able!{end}

{font3}Gwa hah hah ...
{font0}Against this sword and army,
you're nothing but a nuisance.{06}{07}
You'll all be butchered
and humanity will be enslaved.
Nothing can be done.{06}{07}
My servants ...
Begin the slaughter, and do not
leave a single soul standing!{end}

{font3}Gyo hoh hoh!{end}

{font3}Aaahh--!{end}

...{end}

Sonya ...{end}

That's right!
Sonya is Rohga's
little sister.{end}

It's painful when
siblings are at
each others' throats.{06}{07}
Can we attempt
persuasion instead?{end}

There's no need for
siblings to fight each other ...
Won't you talk to her?{end}

I'm sorry for the trouble.
I'm going to her now.
Watch my back!{end}

All right, everyone!{06}{07}
Rohga's going to talk
Sonya into joining us!{end}

It can't be helped ...
I'll give you a hand.{end}

B{3a}ser, prepare yourself.
You're all that's left!{end}

Don't be fooled, imbecile.
I still have Alhazard, and it
will rend your worthless hide!{end}

B{3a}ser, you can't escape!
Get ready to die!{end}

You humans are
tenacious, if nothing else.{06}{07}
I knew I'd have to massacre
you all someday. Hah hah.
All the better with Alhazard ...{06}{07}
Tell me, {02},
do you think you'll hold
us for even a moment?{end}

Of course.
I still wield Langrisser.{06}{07}
We'll decide this world's
destiny, here and now!{end}

...{end}

Liana ...
Hold out a little longer,
I'll save you!{end}

...{end}

My apologies, L{37}na.
Please, hold on.{end}

All right, B{3a}ser.
Hand over Alhazard!{end}

Keep on babbling,
you mortal shit!{end}

It's just like a demon
to say such things!{end}

Why did you
involve yourself now?{06}{07}
Without your interference,
I could have ended
this war far sooner!{end}

Alhazard is dangerous!
Both demons and
humans can wield it.{06}{07}
Don't underestimate
that sword!{end}

Wh, what happened ...
How could I let
Alhazard be taken ...{end}

Gaahh--!
What power ...{end}

Don't get in my way!{end}

Why are you
controlling Sonya!?{end}

Sonya joined me
of her own free will.{06}{07}
Do you hope to frighten
me by swinging your
sword and yelling, little boy?{06}{07}
How fortunate you'll
be dead soon ...{end}

Heh heh.
Go fuck yourself.{06}{07}
You think Sonya would join
you on her own?{06}{07}
Alhazard won't stop
me from spilling your
brains in the dirt.{end}

Sonya, I don't want
to fight you, but ...{end}

So it seems brother Rohga
is just like everyone else ...{06}{07}
I am ordered to crush
all humans, big brother.
I suggest you flee!{06}{07}
No one will trust a half-breed
like me except Lord B{3a}ser!{end}

S, Sonya ...{end}

Why wasn't I prepared ...
At this of all times ...!{end}

Ugh, even seeing
you makes me sick!{end}

Yes, we did it!{end}

Ah, not bad ...{end}

This is your ability?
Pathetic! Hah hah!{end}

B{3a}ser, can your power
stand against a
master magician?{06}{07}
We'll soon see.{end}

Is that a challenge, filth?
Hah hah hah!{06}{07}
How interesting.
Take this!{end}

Why!? I ...{end}

Stay your ground until the
Descendants move in, and they
shall inadvertently aid us.{06}{07}
They can engage the Imperials
and let us slaughter
all our enemies at once!{06}{07}
{font3}Gwa ha ha!{end}

At last, my plan bears fruit.
Alhazard is unsealed
and lies in my hand.{06}{07}
You humans, especially the
Descendants of Light,
have caused me much trouble.{06}{07}
But now, that's impossible.
I'm sending you all to hell.{end}

Aaahhh ...
The ritual was
very demanding ...{06}{07}
I wish it were
otherwise, but we must
withdraw for now.{06}{07}
Humans, savour a few
more breaths ...{06}{07}
When I fully recover,
I'll wipe you from this world!{end}

Wait, B{3a}ser!{end}

What in the hell ...?
That ceremony really
took it out of him.{end}

B{3a}ser must not control
the revived Alhazard.
If we don't do something ...{end}

Damn, we're in for it now!
Should we call
back the troops ...?{end}

We don't stand a
chance as we are ...{06}{07}
Let's fall back and think
of a better strategy.{end}

Ugh ... 
Am I ... Is this it--?{end}

The Dark Princess
is acting pretty strange.{end}

L{37}na ...!
Sister!{end}

Liana!
Why ... are we here?{end}

Are you okay, L{37}na?
Get a hold of yourself!{end}

Are you okay, L{37}na?{end}

Leon!
Why are you ... here?{06}{07}
Aahh ..., I see.
I've been under B{3a}ser's spell.
The power of darkness ...{06}{07}
Ugh!{end}

Sister L{37}na,
are you okay?{end}

Oh, oh yes,
where's B{3a}ser ...?{end}

We should stop to
think about this lest we make
any rash mistakes ...{end}

Will you pursue B{3a}ser?{end}

How else can we
seize Alhazard ...?{06}{07}
We should hunt him
down immediately!{end}

This is amazing!{06}{07}
Are you saying
Langrisser can be
unsealed as well?{end}

Liana ...
Lend me your power.{06}{07}
Break Langrisser's seal and
help us capture Alhazard!{end}

B, but ...{end}

...{06}{07}
Aren't we taking back Alhazard
because it's too dangerous?
Won't Langrisser be the same?{end}

Shh, Sister!{end}

If you aid us,
I promise both of you will
be well-protected.{end}

I understand, {02}.
Let's work together.{end}

Thank you.{06}{07}
Now all that remains is
to seek out B{3a}ser and
seal his darkness forever!{end}

Aren't we going
after Jessica too?{end}

Yes, B{3a}ser will be
recovering for a while yet.{06}{07}
We should strike the
Army of Light while
they're off balance.{end}

That sounds like
the logical choice.
Let's hunt them down.{end}

There's not much time.
We should depart.{end}

Yes, I know.
Everyone, seek out and
destroy Jessica's troops!{end}

Stop it, Sonya.
What have you become,
darkness's lackey?{end}

Brother ...!{end}

Don't you understand?{06}{07}
B{3a}ser's world will
be a living hell!{end}

But I ...{end}

Sonya, please focus.{06}{07}
That maggot fears
our new world.
Do not listen to him.{end}

Y, yes ...!
Master B{3a}ser ...{end}

Yes, do not be confused.
You know what humans are.{end}

Damn you, B{3a}ser ...{end}

Stop trying to control me!{06}{07}
You're just like other humans!
You'll never to listen to me
and you'll never understand!{end}

Brother ...
Brother, why don't
you join us?{end}

I can't do that Sonya ...{06}{07}
I don't give a good damn
about any cause, but I won't
let that asshole take over.{end}

Why ...
Why can't I best humans...?
The next time, surely ...{end}

{font3}The humans took my
land as their own!
I'll have my revenge!{end}

{font3}This grudge
I'll never forget!{end}

{font3}Tasty morsels, come!{end}

{font3}Humans! Hope I
don't kill you
in your sleep!{06}{07}
{font3}I'll be back!{end}

{font3}Attack the humans!{end}

{font3}You cursed humans!{end}

{font3}I, I don't ...{end}

{font3}Ughh ...{end}

B{3a}ser, your
treachery ends here!{end}

Hmmm ... Hah hah.
Do your worst, old hag.{end}

You won't have Alhazard!{end}

So you've arrived, Descendants!
I won't yield to
your so-called justice!{end}

Argh ...
Both the Imperials and
monsters are against us.{06}{07}
This might be too much ...
Some of us are still injured.{end}

The Empire is our
sworn enemy, but ...{06}{07}
I'd sooner help
humans than darkness!{end}

With only a few more men ...
I could have ...{06}{07}
There's no helping it.
I must retreat.{end}

All right you sea swine,
show your captain
what you're made of!{end}

Damn this useless blade!
Let's escape!{end}

Fuck this ...!
I can't move!{end}

Ah ha!{06}{07}
With B{3a}ser's injury,
her mind is free again.{end}

Be patient.{06}{07}
L{37}na's exhausted
from the unsealing ritual.{06}{07}
We must see her
cared for at the castle.{end}

Hmph. It appears
neither of our enemies
were disabled ...{06}{07}
I wonder whom we
should finish first?{06}{07}
{02}, I entrust
this decision to you.{end}

We'll finish off B{3a}ser
after we revive Langrisser.{end}

What!?
This energy ...{end}

Hmmm ...
so the Descendants of Light
have decided to show?{end}

B{3a}ser!
Al, Alhazard ... is it?{end}

Yes, you're late ...
Alhazard was reborn
at this altar.{06}{07}
You'll all be gutter lining
when I'm through with you!{end}

Hmmm ...
B{3a}ser has Alhazard,
{02} has Langrisser ...{06}{07}
Do we stand
a chance here?{end}

The stakes are too high.
We have to fight!{end}

Yes, naturally.{06}{07}
I'll watch for an
opportunity to take
one of the swords.{06}{07}
We must defend humanity!{end}

For a world worth living in,
we must defeat both the Empire
and the forces of darkness!{end}

So they took this long
before they could mobilise ...{06}{07}
Heh, my old Master must
believe she can
simply wait things out ...{06}{07}
Well, that suits us just fine.{06}{07}
I've decided to take Alhazard.
We'll see how this
figures into her little ploy.{end}

Hmmm, a wise decision.{06}{07}
But we need to
revive Langrisser to
secure our victory.{end}

Yes, we must
unlock every ounce of
this blade's power.{06}{07}
How unfortunate ...
We have everything necessary,
save for the Holy Rod.{end}

Laird has been searching for it.
We should consult him.{end}

Sonya! What will it
take to end your
hatred of humans?{06}{07}
Hate only breeds more hate.
You must understand that!{end}

You're right, brother ...
After you left home, the humans
treated me like dirt!{06}{07}
Men publicly beat me ...
The children
threw stones at me!{06}{07}
I had no friends,
no one to love,
and no brother ...{06}{07}
Now I've embraced my
demon blood and Master B{3a}ser.{06}{07}
Humans hated me and
now I'll return their hate!{end}

That's right, Sonya.
Humans are selfish beings who
need excuses to be kind.{end}

You bastard ...!
I'll shut your worthless mouth!{end}

Everyone just go away!
S, stop messing with my head!{end}

S, Sonya!{end}

The fine chain above the
magic formation has fallen.{06}{07}

Will you pick it up?{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{06}{07}

Has something vanished
from the magic formation?{end}

A metal plate has dropped from
above the magic formation.{06}{07}

Will you take it?{end}

A magnificent
shield appeared!{end}

Obtained Odin's Buckler.{06}{07}

Another item just vanished
from the magic formation.{end}
