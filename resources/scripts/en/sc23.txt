Both the Dark Rod and the
sealing maidens are here.{06}{07}
The preparations
are complete ...{06}{07}
Now let's commence with
Alhazard's revival!{06}{07}
{font4}Deofcynn Strengthe ...
{font4}Blaed of Foregenga ...
{font4}Alhazard ...{end}

Egbert, stop!{end}

Hmmm ...
You've managed
to sniff us out.{end}

You must know how
dangerous Alhazard is!{end}

Power is a matter
of preference.{06}{07}
Using Alhazard is no
different than abusing
the power of light ...{06}{07}
Now, watch the unveiling
of a truly magnificent force.{end}

So this is the
Temple of Evil ...
What an eerie place.{end}

Look at the altar!{end}

Ahhh!
It's Lady Liana and L{37}na!{end}

The Maiden of Light and
the Maiden of Darkness ...{end}

The Maiden of Light
sealed the Dark Blade ...
At least that's my take on it.{end}

Then what's the
Dark Princess' role?{end}

It's her duty to break
the seal and become
one with darkness.{end}

If we're careless, the
ceremony will be completed.{end}

That's right.
Before the seal is broken,
we must defeat Egbert!{06}{07}
Get ready, everyone!{end}

I must concentrate
to complete the ritual.{06}{07}
Until it's complete, don't
allow them near the altar!{end}

Yes, leave it to us ...{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

The ritual is complete.
Alhazard's seal has broken.{06}{07}
All that remains is to
present it to His Majesty.{end}

Stop, Egbert! If Bernhardt
uses Alhazard's power, he
will become host to B{3a}ser!{end}

In the case of an ordinary
person, that may be true.{06}{07}
But you still can't imagine the
true strength of His Majesty.
His steely will can
repel even Darkness.{06}{07}
I'm certain His Majesty
will be able to master
Alhazard's power.{end}

We have a problem.
As it is, Bernhardt will
possess Alhazard.{end}

Everyone! 
Quickly defeat the enemy,
then follow Egbert!{end}

Hear me, oh
slumbering Chaos!{end}

Vanquish the intruding
light, unbind the evil
centuries old ...{06}{07}
And bring forth the
power that once was!{06}{07}
{font4}Geweald of Uncer Metod,
{font4}Andwyrdon Thin Cilden ...
{font4}Aweccan Alhazard! {end}

Stop, the seal is ...!{end}

Watch out!
Alhazard's seal has
been lifted!{end}

Cough ... Cough ... Wheeze ...{06}{07}
Th, this is ...{06}{07}
The Demons' Might,
Alhazard ...{end}

Egbert!
What are you doing!{end}

Damn it!
He's taken it.{end}

I will deliver this sword
to His Majesty. Don't let
them leave here alive!{end}

Understood ...{end}

Yes!{end}

The fine chain above the
magic formation has fallen.{06}{07}

Will you pick it up?{end}

Obtained Gleipnir.{06}{07}

Has something vanished
from the magic formation?{end}

A metal plate has dropped from
above the magic formation.{06}{07}

Will you take it?{end}

A magnificent
shield appeared!{06}{07}

Obtained Odin's Buckler.{06}{07}

Another item just vanished
from the magic formation.{end}

Damn, no good ...{end}

How could we allow
Alhazard to ...
Right before our very eyes ...{end}

I'm sorry ...{end}

Ouch!
What are you doing!{end}

This is it ...!
Let me fall back,
just this once.{06}{07}
Forgive me!{end}

I'm sorry everyone ...
Please stop Egbert!{end}

I'm way too old for
this kind of fighting ...{06}{07}
{02}, watch out
for the Princess!{end}

Ahh, they got me.
If only I was a
little stronger--{end}

Egbert!{06}{07}
Even with B{3a}ser defeated,
Alhazard's unbridled
power is too dangerous.{06}{07}
You know the horrors
that darkness will bring!
Why are you doing this!?{end}

Hmmm ...
Such sentimental babble ...{06}{07}
To achieve my purpose,
I will do anything that
can guarantee our success!{end}

You've changed, Egbert ...{06}{07}
You've become
so wretched ...{end}

Ahh ...
Egbert ...{end}

Ha ha ha!
You have my sincere apologies.{06}{07}
Farewell, Adviser to the
Descendants of Light.{end}

Impossible!
We're too late.{end}

Let's go.{end}

Die!{end}

Argh!{end}

You think you can take me?
Interesting. Go ahead and try!{end}

Damn!{end}

They're pretty tough ...{end}

Let's go!{end}

Come!
My magic will have
you writhing in agony!{end}

Power ...
I need more power ...{end}

Egbert ... 
I'm sorry ...{end}

Hmph.
That's all you've got?{end}

Egbert ...{end}

No good ...
I can't hold out any more ...{end}

We managed to save
L{37}na and Liana ...{06}{07}
But we let him
revive Alhazard ...{end}

Hmmm.{end}

You've come to, Liana!{end}

Aahh ...
{02}!{end}

Thank goodness,
she's okay ...{end}

Liana joins the entourage!{end}

L{37}na looks fine too.{end}

L{37}na looks all right, too.{end}

I, I was ...{end}

Egbert's spell has
been broken.{end}

Has the spell been broken?{end}

Sister!
Big sister L{37}na!{end}

Liana? 
Is it really you, Liana?{end}

L{37}na, I thought
I would never
see you again ...{end}

Huh? I never knew
Lady Liana had a sister.{end}

Speaking of which,
why am I here?{end}

B{3a}ser ...{06}{07}
When I was young, I was
separated from Liana and
kidnapped by B{3a}ser.{06}{07}
Uggh!
My head ...{06}{07}
What happened to Alhazard?{end}

Egbert took it ...
But I have no idea
where he is.{end}

It's okay. If I sense
Alhazard's energy wave,
I can guide us to its position.{end}

...{end}

It seems Kaiser Bernhardt
is in Velzeria.{06}{07}
From there, I can
feel a strong evil ...{end}

Underneath Castle Velzeria,
I've heard the
God of Chaos sleeps.{06}{07}
It doesn't take a
genius to figure out
Alhazard was taken there.{end}

Then let's hurry
on to Velzeria!{end}

No!
First we must
revive Langrisser.{06}{07}
Only the Sword of Light
can challenge Alhazard now.{06}{07}
Langrisser's true
power is yet to be seen.{end}

What?
You mean it can be
even more powerful?{end}

You mean it has even
more untapped power?{end}

Wow ...{end}

Correct ...{06}{07}
To break the seal, we
need the Holy Rod from
the Ruins of Elrad.{end}

While I was controlled, I
hurt many innocent people.
Please let me help you ...{06}{07}
Please, at least let
me do that much ...{end}

Don't worry, no
one is blaming you.{end}

Thank you.{end}

L{37}na joins the entourage!{end}

All right, first we must
retrieve the Holy Rod.{end}

Well, I'll leave it to you
youngsters. This fighting
is too much for me ...{end}

You're going back?
You'll be sorely missed.{end}

Master Aaron,
please leave it to us.
Take a well-deserved rest.{end}

Everyone, be strong.{end}

{02},
take care of the Princess!{end}

Aaron leaves the entourage ...{end}

Take care, Aaron.{end}

Sorry, but please try
to let me return home.{06}{07}
It seems I'm too old
to fight. If I keep going,
I'll just wind up holding
you all back.{end}

Are you sure?
You'll be missed.{end}

Master, I'm strong,
so don't worry.{end}

{02},
take care of the Princess!{end}

Aaron leaves the entourage ...{end}

Thanks for everything.
Farewell.{end}

You were controlled
by B{3a}ser.{06}{07}
After B{3a}ser was
killed, Egbert used his
magic on you.{end}

Everyone!
Slaughter the
Descendants of Light!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

Aaahh!
He ran away!{end}

We have to hurry up
and follow him ...{06}{07}
But first, we must rescue
Liana and L{37}na!{06}{07}
Quickly, clear
out the enemy!
Let's go!{end}
