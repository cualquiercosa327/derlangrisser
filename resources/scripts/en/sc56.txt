...{end}

Princess, ...
are you all right?{end}

What? Oh, yes.{06}{07}
I'm just concerned
about Lester.
He's not usually late.{end}

Try to focus.
The coming battle
won't be easy ...{end}

Yes, we have to face both
the Empire and {02}.{end}

No ...! Everyone!
The Imperial Army is here!{end}

Cherie, your purposeless
struggle has gone long enough.
Surrender now.{end}

Where is Lester?
What happened to him?{end}

He fought bravely
to his final moments.{end}

Lord Lester ...{end}

Now we definitely
can't give up!{06}{07}
Too many friends
have given their lives ...
We'll win this for them!{end}

Hmph. Always remember,
the choice was yours.{end}

Who's there!?{end}

Rethink your pride.{06}{07}
Would sacrificing
yourself make these
friends happy?{end}

Kaiser ... Bernhardt!?{end}

I want peace to flourish,
and, slowly, I've aimed for
continental alliance.{06}{07}
I've no thirst for power nor
blood, my goal is not
conquest for its own sake ...{06}{07}
Why can't you understand?
Only your pride
stands against lasting peace.{end}

You want us to shake
hands and forget
you killed our comrades?{06}{07}
Kaiser, prepare yourself!{end}

Gwah!{end}

How useless ...{end}

You should know well,
we're the persistent type!{06}{07}
I could never serve you!
In fact, I'd rather die!{end}

What a waste ...{end}

Idiots! Even with our defeat,
your peace would
remain a foolish dream!{06}{07}
Do you think people will
hold hands and join in song?{06}{07}
Without order,
there will be war!{end}

I'd rather avoid this,
but we need to locate
the shrine maidens.{end}

I see. We must fight
to complete our mission.{end}

Hmmm ... must we
continue to face these
sorts of enemies ...?{end}

{02}, I leave
this to your command.{end}

Yes, Your Majesty!{end}

It's too narrow.
I don't think we can continue.{end}

Huh? What?{end}

Shit!
We're late!{end}

Reinforcements?
Wait, ... why are you here?{end}

Princess, there's no
need for questions.{06}{07}
Please, let us assist you!{end}

Though we're retired,
we'll never abandon
Kalxath or our Princess!{end}

Thank you ...
for your support, everyone.{end}

Oh, this castle won't
be easy to penetrate.{end}

Indeed. This place ...{06}{07}
This is where the century-old
"War for the Holy Sword"
transpired ... Twin Castle.{end}

"War for the Holy Sword ...?"{06}{07}
So my ancestor battled
for Langrisser here ...{end}

Correct. At that time ...{06}{07}
A man of ambition desired
Langrisser, and for it, he
laid siege to Castle Baldea.{06}{07}
Now, one hundred years later,
Cherie chose this stronghold of
the annihilated Dalshis Empire.{06}{07}
I wonder why.{end}

The Descendants of Light
must be hiding inside ...!{end}

To be honest, you resemble
the Dalshis quite a bit.{06}{07}
Empires are all the same ...
They want Langrisser
for their own selfish ends!{end}

I heard about the war 
from my mentor, Doren.{06}{07}
The ancient Kaiser Digos
spearheaded a campaign
to conquer the continent.{06}{07}
He lusted after Langrisser's
power, but in the end, he
only reawakened darkness.{06}{07}
Because of that, monsters
came into this world ...{end}

That's too familiar.
Could Rayguard Empire
be repeating history?{end}

It's different this time.
We put an end to B{3a}ser,
darkness's incarnation.{06}{07}
With his demise,
monsters can't cause
us much trouble.{end}

Too bad none of that matters.
This castle will be your grave!{end}

Oh, is the little girl
threatening us?
That's really cute!{end}

Listen up, everyone.
Save your strength!{06}{07}
Allow them to enter the castle's
narrow passages,
and we'll attack from the air.{end}

Excellent plan, Princess!{end}

Okay everyone,
do your best!{end}

Looks like this is
our chance.{06}{07}
All units, counterattack!{end}

Not bad, {02}.
You're clever ...{06}{07}
If they break through,
Jessica and Liana
will be in danger.{06}{07}
We must stop them
no matter what.{end}

Princess, the enemies
are closing rapidly.{end}

Well done, {02}, ...
but we'll do whatever
it takes to repel you.{06}{07}
Jessica's counting on us.{end}

There is a notice scrawled
behind the three boxes.{06}{07}

"You've stumble on my hoard!
Select a box for your reward."{06}{07}

Which will you pick?{end}

The right box{end}

The middle box{end}

The left box{end}

Obtained Magic Mushroom.{06}{07}

You feel no urge to stomp
on turtles or crawl in pipes ...{06}{07}

As you discard the fungus,
the other two boxes vanish.{end}

Obtained Pet Rock.{06}{07}

Unfortunately, they have fallen
out of fashion in El Sallia ...{06}{07}

As you discard the rock,
the other two boxes vanish.{end}

As you raise the lid,
the other two boxes vanish.{06}{07}

Obtained Rune Stone.{end}

Cherie, stop this.
I don't want to kill you!{end}

What the hell are
you suggesting?
That I just give up?{06}{07}
Keith, Aaron, Kalxath's men ...
You want me to spit
on their deaths!? I won't!{06}{07}
Only a selfish coward
would think like you!{end}

What the ...!?
I'm here ... and now I'm dead?
Just like that ...? {end}

Death is inevitable
on the battlefield ...{06}{07}
If this was only about me,
I'm glad to have
died by your hands ...{06}{07}
Goodbye,
{02} ...{end}

We'll show you
our true power!{end}

It's no good ...
I need a little time to
treat my wound.{end}

So you found your sister, eh?
Congratulations.{end}

Thanks.{06}{07}
Well, let's see what happens
if we offer surrender.{end}

That's entirely different!{end}

Damn it! They're tougher
than we thought!{end}

Don't spare any rebels,
not even the women!
That's how we'll do this.{end}

I thought so.{end}

Tsk! Should we
retreat for a while ...?{end}

So you're that stupid?
I bet {02}'s
fallen in love too.{06}{07}
It'd be nice if you'd
have some common sense.{end}

Q, quiet!{end}

We're done for.
I'm leaving you in charge.{end}

I am General of the
Blazing Dragon Army!
I don't lose to amateurs.{end}

Bastard, how dare you!{end}

I won't die here.
I will unite this continent and
seal the Dark Blade!{end}

I ... can't be helped.
Let me rest for a while.{end}

B, brother ...{end}

Don't be rash.
Withdraw, now!{end}

Ugh ...{end}

You're impressive
as ever, {02} ...{06}{07}
Even this castle's solid
defence fell to you.{06}{07}
But for Keith, Lester, Aaron,
and everyone else ...
we absolutely cannot give up!{06}{07}
Now, charge!
{02}, you're mine!{end}

{02} ...
Take my sword!{end}

...{06}{07}
{02} ...?
Where's {02} ...?{end}

I'm over here, Cherie ...{end}

I, I didn't expect
to beat you ...{06}{07}
But I didn't give in ...
At least I ... did that ...{end}

Please don't ...!
You've said enough, Cherie.{end}

I've always wanted to fight
beside you, {02} ...{06}{07}
The life of a Princess
wasn't for me ...{end}

...{end}

You should know,
{02} ...{06}{07}
All my life, people have
thought of me as royalty.{06}{07}
You were the first ...
to treat me like a person.
I ... respect you for that ...{06}{07}
Sorry, ...
I'm confusing, aren't I ...?{06}{07}
But, ... I ...
love ... you ...{end}

Cherie, why ...?{end}

How could she fight
the man she loved?{06}{07}
It doesn't make much sense.
At least, not to me ...{06}{07}
I suppose her
divine duty was more
important ...?{end}

Just a little longer,
and we'll stop this sadness.{06}{07}
If Brother didn't
take me in, I might have
died like that ...{end}

The Descendants of Light
were forced into war
because of their heritage.{06}{07}
Just as the Princess had
to fight because of hers ...{end}

I remember ...{06}{07}
Keith often said that
Cherie would
sneak from the castle.{end}

Strange girl ...{end}

Hmph ...!
Stop being foolish.{06}{07}
Cherie was our enemy.
Always remember that.{06}{07}
We should respect her
determination, but her ideals
were pure fantasy.{end}

Jessica is on
the top floor ...{end}

I understand how you feel.
How long can you
keep this up, {02}?{06}{07}
Let's escort the shrine
maidens back. They are needed
for Alhazard's resealing.{end}

...{06}{07}
I'm sorry you all
had to witness this.{06}{07}
I never knew about Cherie ...,
but in war, I should
be prepared for anything.{end}

That's all well and good,
but we can't stay here.{06}{07}
If we don't bring back
Liana and L{37}na, we can't
reseal Alhazard.{end}

Are we going ...
to the final battle ...?{end}

Let's go!
To our final battle!{end}

Please, cover me!{end}

Yes, Sir!{end}

We'll protect the Princess
with our lives!{end}

Princess ...
I've failed you ...
F, forgive me ...{end}

No ...!
Pull yourself together!{end}

Gaahhh ...!
With this ... 
I will see my friends again ...{end}

Hmmm, so {02}
has broken through?
Damn it ...{end}

Princess, don't worry!
We'll protect you to the end!{end}

These worthless scoundrels
will pay for raising a
blade against the Princess!{end}

Just a little more ...
Only one more person ...,
the enemy ...{end}

That's enough.
Don't be careless!{06}{07}
You've fought hard enough.
For now, please rest.{end}

Princess ...,
thank you.{06}{07}
What kind words.
A little ... rest ...{end}

If everyone is dead,
what am I fighting for ...?{end}

To pass here, you'll
have to get through me!{end}

Hmph ...
Very interesting, ...
but let's move on.{end}

Now is the time.
Throw everything you
have at them!{end}

Good luck, and
be careful!{end}

Charge!{end}

I should never
have enlisted ...{end}

Stop worrying
about me!{end}

B, bastard ...{end}

Cherie, ...
I'm sorry ...{end}

Impressive, so you're the
elite troops of the Empire!{end}

Don't worry, we'll
stop your advance.{end}

Uugghh ...
What ... pain ...{end}

Now, air units!
Take them
from the side!{end}

Understood!{end}

Leave it to me!{end}

I didn't think this ...
would ... happen ...{end}

You won't pass ...
I ... won't let ... you ...{end}

It's sickening to think
that this {02} once
fought beside our princess!{end}

I'll make you taste
the dust on my blade!{end}

Princess, ...
I failed you ... 
Forgive ... me ...{end}

Impudent whelps!{end}

We'll stop you, Imperials!
Men, take them from behind.{end}

P, Princess ...{end}

Impudent whelps!{end}

We'll fire off whatever
magic we have left!{end}

I gladly give my life
for the Princess.{06}{07}
And anyway, there's
no reason to flee
from the likes of them!{end}

Thank you, everyone,
for assisting me
in this cruel war ...{end}

Escape already!
{02} isn't an
opponent you can defeat!{end}

I wonder how many
lives have been lost ...
All because of this ...{end}
