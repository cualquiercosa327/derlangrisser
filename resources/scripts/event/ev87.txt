# Each unit type is characterised by unique attributes which, in combat, may be beneficial or detrimental.\r\nThere are five major properties:\r\nInfantry are strong to spearmen but weak against cavalry. Spearmen are strong to cavalry but weak against infantry.\r\nCavalry are strong against infantry but weak against spearmen. Sea units are slow on land but fast in the water.\r\nFlying units have excellent mobility and gain an attack advantage by being airborne, but they are weak to bowmen.\r\nBowmen can attack the enemy from a distance and are strong against flying units.\r\nHowever, when bowmen are caught in a direct attack, they can easily be wiped out.\r\nCarefully consider the map's terrain, as well as commander arrangement, prior to hiring your troops.\0
