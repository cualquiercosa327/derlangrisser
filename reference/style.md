# Der Langrisser Style Guide

This guide is prepared as a reference for everyone editing the Der Langrisser script. It explains preferred spellings, capitalization and punctuation rules, and titles.

For individual item and character names, refer to the spellings in sc01 and sc02.

Make sure no line of text ever has less than two words on it. Manually adjust text flow by adding the {08} tag if needed.

**Alhazard:** A named weapon, refer to it as a proper noun and do not indicate an article before it. Never call it “the Alhazard.”

On Independent path, it would be assumed he holds the rank of General as it’s his own army. In the independent ending he is named King.

He is often referred to by the epithets “Red Head” or “Prince of Baldea.”

## P

**priests:** While the Japanese text does contain a distinction between priests and a Shinto priest, this is not being repeated in the English. Simply refer to any sort of priest as a priest. If a case arises where there could be confusion, call the Shinto priest a “shrine priest.”

---

**Punctuation:** Punctuation rules for Langrisser follow Standard English:

* Apostrophe should follow normal English usage, except in cases of proper singular names ending in “s.” See the entry on possession for more information.
* Ellipses (…) should be treated as a three letter word. Use it to indicate pauses in text. As a three letter word, separate with spaces on each side, except when leading into another punctuation mark. Represent this in script as “...” Never repeat ellipses or join them together. Avoid beginning a line with an ellipsis.
* Em dash (—) may be used to set off pieces of text in a way that draws more attention than commas, as a substitute for thoughts normally expressed in parenthesis, as a replacement for a colon or semicolon to draw attention to a second clause, or to show the interruption or trailing off of a final thought. Yes, it’s that versatile. Represent this in script with “--”
* Exclamation marks should really already be understood … simply don’t abuse them. Not every sentence needs one to convey emotion.
* Interrobang (‽) is not supported. Instead, always use “?!” While there is no true English rule for this, question mark first is the preferred method. Never repeat more than one interrobang.
* Hyphen (-) is used to join two words or certain set phrases. Do not hyphenate words to break them across multiple lines. Simply revise the text.
* Quotation marks (“ … ”) should only be used to set off direct quotations spoken by the characters, or something being read out loud. Other punctuation marks must always go within quotation marks—even those inferred from outside the quotation. Represent them in script with the double-prime mark ("), the formatter automatically converts them to smart quotes.

---

## S

**stat bonus:** Some secret tiles give bonuses to character stats. All such lines should follow the form “____ raised by X point(s).” Preferred abbreviations for stats are listed below:

* AT – Attack Power
* DF – Defence Power

* MP – Magic Points
* Movement
* Range

---

**stutter:** Represent a stutter by the first syllable followed by a comma, then the word.

Example: O, Okay. Th, that’s terrible …

Do not use an ellipsis in place of the comma.

---

## T

**titles:** Honorary titles for each character that takes one are listed by their names in the style guide. On first reference, call someone by their complete title. On second reference, only use their name or title alone.

Example: Captain Leon doesn’t believe in this mission! The captain only undertook it as a direct order from Kaiser Bernhardt!

There are four titles of special note: Lord, Lady, Sir and Dame. Lord and Lady may be applied to anyone’s name as a sign of respect, similar to the original function of honorific –san or –sama in the Japanese text. Sir and Dame should be used respectively in military settings with Dame being the feminine form.

---
